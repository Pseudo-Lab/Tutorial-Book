I knew that they never talk bad about me.\\\\n\\\\nNow, my husband is my best friend. He is the most important people of my life. He has ever been with me. Also, he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him. Both like to travel around the world and to practise some sports, for example, tennis, running or trekking.

There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown. In my childhood, I went there to spend my summer every year. However, it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set.\\\\n\\\\nNext to go will be, the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution. There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral. No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented.\\\\n\\\\nLast but not the least, the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence, especially, to our offspring. To take my friend, Taylor, as an example, her homeland were over-developed and become an arid place when she was a child. After she grows up, she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown. In addition, she has no blithe memory in her childhood.\\\\n\\\\nOne problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us. Due to the mineral development, many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before. It seems like a sought-after chance. Nevertheless, they do not give us any promise of the vacancy. In addition, money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation.\\\\n\\\\nIn a nutshell, Based on the reasons and instances above, the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage.
