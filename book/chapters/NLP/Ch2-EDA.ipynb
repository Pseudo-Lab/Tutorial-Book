Afterall, what affects one family may or may not affect another although the families has a common genetic make up, shared by either of the parents. In cases where an individual has gotten to know of a genetic disorder, disclosing or otherwise, to his or her relative is solely a matter of preference within the indivdial moral system.\n",

              "The issue on right to know or not to know is highly debatable although it is a genetic risk, one cannot be entire sure because the genetic information could possibly result from the families of either parents - his maternal and paternal uncles, aunts or cousin. This also means that as soon a person is made aware of his or her genetic profile, he or she concurently has a knowledge about others. This knowledge maybe relavant to them, and vice versa. An example that may serve as an illustration is breast cancer. It is hereditary. Do one who suffered from this disease keep it a secret of infrom their relatives? In retrospect, its is also ones duty to ensure that he or she undergo periodic healthchecks in their own.\n",

              "Sometimes some family structure and cultural beliefs can influence the pattern of communication. Depending on whom the genetic risk was discovered from: the son or daughter for example, the parents who knows about this would decide who gets told and whom takes the precedence in being 'allowed' to tell. For example, within a family, regardless of who had first received genetic information, parents were seen as having the primary responsibility to pass on information to any offspring, either adult at risk. In addition, a woman testing positive for BRCA1 would be expected to allow her brother or sister to disclose such information to a niece or nephew rather than do it herself, although this may be further complicated by an individual's response to risk information as they not want to know. Hence, there were also tensions if participants felt that they could neither pass on information to relatives who needed to know (such as nieces and nephews) nor persuade those with authority (the parents) to do so.\n",

For example, a grandmother may have more authority to pass on information than an aunt, even when she is not at genetic risk herself while the aunt is. From a practitioner's perspective these findings are important because if lay constructs of the family and kinship are a social construct they may not be in line with geneticists' views of family relationships, or about which blood (or non-blood) relatives should be informed and by whom; this is also likely to be dependent on the cultural and ethnic context.\n",

In this case, if one of the family members or close relatives is found to carry genetic risk, it is better for the patient to tell his/her close relatives about the issue and let others known about the risk so that his/her familay members are able to perform some daily excesses to prevent the potential disease or they may go to hospital and check for the correspongding flows. In my opinion, although the annouance of carrying a genetic risk involves the issue of self privacy, it is necessary for the carrier to be obligated to tell the issue to his or her relatives in order for them to prevent the potential disease. I agree with this statement to a large extent.\n",

Large numbers of patients with the genetic risk would want to keep it as a secret as the genetic risk may indicates their high chance to carry certain disease. Especially for the young people without marrige, if he/she is known to have some genetic risk, it may have certain chance that his/her child would carry the same disease, but not in certain. Therefore, to keep the information as secret to his/her future spouce would help the relationship. Secondly, annouance the potential risk would cause the family member to be scared of this certain issue, although the factor would not be that serious, people would still fear that they would have some potential disease in the future thus go to hospital and do additional check or take more medicine in order to prevent the disease, and this creats unnecessary costs to the family. Furthermore, the annouance of genetic risk would affect the relationship with the relatives as sometimes others may think not to stay too close to the carrier so that they have less chance to get the potential disease.\n",

First, for the case of marrige, people should be honest and tell his/her spouce they may carry certain genetic risk that may affect their offsprings. It is better to let the other party know the fact than after the baby is born and certain type of genetic disease is found. It is better for both parties to be honest. Secondly, genetic disease has a close relationship with the born gene together with their daily habits. For example, if a carrier is told that he/she has the risk to have diabetes. In this case, the carrier can eat less candies and chocolates to prevent intake to much sugars, and at the same time, if the carrier tell this information to the relatives, it will be useful for them to know that they may have diabetes in the future becouse of related genes and they can perform the same exercise to intake less sugar to prevent the disease. Otherwise, if the other parties did not know, they may end up with to have diabete in the future without any prevention.\n",

Genetic disorder may or may not be hirataged hereditary disease and it is sometimes hard to find out one has these kinds of diseases.

If a law requires someone to tell others' his or her privacy especially when the one is not willing to do so. It is againt his or her human rights and it is against the law's spirit. The law's spirit also include the fairness. What is the basic difference between genetic disorder and other disorders. It is unfair to release a law only point to the genetic disorder. In addition, it is impractical to make such a law. A good law should be clear and easy to execute. However, there are many problems againt the execution of asking a carrier to tell his or her ralatives the cause of his or her diseases. Firstly, what is the range of the relatives? For example, does the carrier only need to tell his or her direct relatives like parents and brothers and sisters or does he also need to tell relatives like his grandmother's sister's son's daughter's nephew? If you say only need to tell direct relatives, it will be against the fairness of law. Other relatives may have the same possibilities to have such kind of disease.

By doing this ,they may be able to save some lives of their relatives. It is because a carrier with bad gene may not necessary have those genetic disease, if they can have coresponding healthy lifestyle before the age that the gene's function become stronger. A typical example is genetic caused hypertension. Hypertension can be caused by genetic problems which make the carrier harder to digest the fat and salt in blood which can cause hypertension. People usually get this kind of hypertesion after they become adult. However, if they already know they have a gene that may make them have higher possibilities to get hypertention. They can build a daily habit to eat less salt and fat and thus to avoid hypertension.\n",

              "In the age of rapid technological advancement, a lot of medical breakthroughs are made possible. Genetic testing is made possible and available for one's decision to undergo. It is able to detect the illnesses or diseases and even a child's parentage. However, it will become a controversial issue as it becomes a dilemma for a carrier of a known genetic risk to inform his or her relatives. If the knowledge of the genetic risk was to be shared within the family or relatives, there might have chances for them to have it in their blood, which they may do necessary precautions to prevent. But, if it is a terminal disease as a genetic disease, most of the relatives will be disheartened upon having the knowledge about it. Therefore, some carriers will have the opinion of keeping it as a secret. This essay will discuss about whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives or not.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "Some said that the genetic risk that is found in a person should be kept secret because it is considered as a personal information which should be kept confidential. Most patients will be depressed after realising his or her conditions. If one has a genetic disease after the test, he or she might not wish to inform the relatives as he might ended up dishearten his extended family. Some will wish to keep it to themselves and hope to ensure that they will not bring in any pessimism into their family. Furthermore, some will wish not to become a burden of anyone as seeking medical attention is relatively costly. Hence, some seen it as being considerate in keeping the genetic risk of getting the disease in confidential.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "On the other hand, others may think that it will be considerate to tell the relatives because the latter will have a higher tendency of getting the same genetic risk. Hence, they will be able to seek help from medical specialists to find a cure or to do some measures to prevent the risk of getting the disease. Nevertheless, it will depend on what kind of genetic diseases, given in the context of current medical technology. For example, breast cancer is a genetic disease and it can be cured if it is being realised in the early stage. Hence, with the knowledge of having genetic risk, the relatives of this genetic disease will do a medical check-up, which might save them in realising it at a earlier stage.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "In conclusion, it will be considerate to inform the risk of getting the same genetic disease to the relatives. Although there might be a lot of challenges along the way in seeking medical attention, such as financial issue, everyone should be given the rights of knowing their family's inherented medical conditions. However, some think that it might be better for those who are ignorant about it and will continue leading a happy life. In addition, some may think that even knowing about having genetic risk of the disease, it will just adding on to their misery as there is nothing that they can do about it. All-in-all, it depends on individual and also the nature of the disease, but he or she should be obligated to inform the relatives if there are possibilities in curing or preventing it.\n",

Those who are born into a family with a history of genetic disease should be allowed to undergo genetic testing, even though if there is no risk at all.

There should not be forced or obligied to do so, as it may negatively and drastically affect the emotions of the genetic risk carrier. With regard to this choice given, there must be some rules to regulate and exercise personal freedom of decision making. If the genetic risk carrier is a minor or a child, then most likely the decision of informing the relative should be made with the consideration of the patients parents or legal guardian. Such patients are still emotionally volatile or they may be unaware of the consequences of such genetic disorder due to their young age. Furthermore the act of informing others without the consent from their parents or the patients itself could harm the psychological state of the affected family. Thus, much thought need to put on the immediate family as it could caused a stir of unwanted events from the patient or the family members itself. Some family may feel hurt , with regards to their family pride or reputation, on having the knowledge of such genetic disorder running in their family.\n",

There might be a possibility that the genetic disorder could also affect their relatives and any other families within the same family tree. The importance of informing relatives of such genetic disease is vital as it may help to raise awareness and prevention towards the genetic disorder. Also, this known information will help their relatives to make informed decisions and tosimilarly undergo genetic testingto find out about the outcome. Thus, having the knowledge that such genetic disorder is benign would be beneficial towards their emotinal thoughts. And if the results turn out to be otherwise, then the family can be prepared emotionally and psychologically of the future outcome and aid them in making upcoming decisions. In addition, the genetic risk carrier would be showered with moral and emotional support from their relatives if it is been made known to them. Having support from relatives are vital as they ensure the genetic risk carrier that he/she is not alone in facing this illness and it will certainly provide a morale boost as the whole family will share a common sentiment with regards towards the future prospect of the genetic disorder which could be inherited by anyone in the family. Therefore, the decision to inform relatives of such genetic disorder will be dependent of the situation and backgroung of the affected family, with the liberty of choice given to them in making the decision of informing others.\n",

              "A person with a disorder, regardless of mental or physical disorder, is always easy to be awared by his or her families. When things come to genetic issues, it is not that simple anymore. Genetic disorder inheritance is generation by generation, but not all of the offsprings show the relevant symptoms. Sometimes a family with potential genetic disorder risk may not be able to detect the potential harm inside their bodies as none of their members reflect any observable disorder symptoms. As a result, in the case that when one of the members happen to feel uncomfortable or unnormal, he or she should aware that whether the disorder in his or her body is a genetic risk or not. Afterward, the carrier will face a serious ethical issue, which is to reveal the problem to his or her relatives or not.\n",

              "If the disorder symptoms reflect on a kid, the parent will be informed by the medics for sure, then the whole family will stay alert to their bodies' condition. On contrary, if the carrier is an adult, who has his own choice to choose whether to inform his or her relatives about the risk, that will be more complex. One may think that if the carrier is a caring person who loves his or her family more than himself, there is no doubt that he or she will tell his or her family about the issue. That is true and of course it is the obligation of a family member to protect and take care of the family. Think of the other way, if a child of the family knows that he has the risk to become a genetic risk carrier, and the risk might as well inherit to his child in the future, his whole life will be in a dilenma. And of course, he or she will think of not having any child after getting married, and the same thought goes to the cousins as well. As a result, the family generation stops by the moment the adult carrier announces his issue.\n",

              "In China, the older generation with traditional culture background, will always think of having more children as well as grandchildren, to make the family liven up and stronger. The reason behind is that after WOWII the population of China decreased dramatically and so the government encourage the people to give more birth. During that period, if one of the family member reflects genetic disorder symptoms, he will fell in an ethical dilenma for sure. The medical treatment technology during that time is not advanced enough to completely cure him. He has to choose whether to protect his family or make his family more prosperity with a potential generic risk. And so, he would have chosen not to undergo generic disorder testing and let the truth be mined forever. This kind of ethical issue cannot be judged by the others because they will not understand the position and duty of the carrier in the family.\n",

It is an obligation for a carrier to inform his relatives, but also an obligation for a family member to liven up the family. Regardlessly, if the disorder is rarely to be fatal, or it does not caused any inconvenience to the carrier, revealing the truth is always the right thing to do.\n",

              "In my opinion, the carrier should tell his or her relatives about it. One of the reasons why is because as a carrier, she or he needs a mental support to go through with this situation. It will be hard for an individual to deal with the issue on its own. By telling to his or her family other than being a support, they could possibly help her to get alternative solutions to the problem that she is facing right now. Other than that, I believe that the stong bond we have with our family is the biggest pillar of support to the carrier. Furthermore, as it is a genetic problem, it will be better for the carrier to inform his or her family as other family member might experience the same thing. By making sure that they are aware of this genetic problem, they could have a full check-up for themselves and it will be better if they could even prevent it from happening to themselves. I find that it is important to inform especially if it is contagious, the carrier could prevent the disease from spreading out to the society.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "For every action there is always pros and cons. I believe that some of the carriers will choose to not reveal their disease to the family members as they do not want to make their family members worry and feel uncomfortable or even feel ostracized by them. Furthermore, as it could incur spending a lots of money for the treatment, the carrier might not want to be the burden in her family. I could understand the feeling of the carrier. She or he does not want to be the source of unhappiness in thefamily. However, we will never know whether this negative effects will happen when the carrier decide to tell his or her family of the his or her condition.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In conclusion, personally I feel that it is better for the carrier to inform her family members about the issue. The carrier should be honest with his or her feeling and I find that it is the right of the family member to know what is going on to his or her life. If anything wrong happened to the carrier's life, without informing the family members it could make a huge regret in their life if she leaves without them knowing about it. On top of that, it is better to think about solutions for her problem with the family members as there are more heads to think about it rather than thinking about it alone and struggling on your own. In the end, I believe that the support in terms of mental or even monetary from your family could help the carrier to fight against the genetic disease. True enough that there are lots of cancer's patient who were given second choice to live as a normal person as they have a strong mental support from their loved one. In my opinion, as long as we keep our mind healthy and strong, we can fight any disease as they come to us when we are fragile and weak.\n",

              "As the techonology has been advancing, it has reached a stage whereby the advancement triggers some ethical dilemmas in relation to the acutual use of the techonology. Genetic testing has been made possible- it has become easy to tell if one is a carrier of a known genetic risk through genetic testing. If used for a good purpose, it can prevent unnecessary unhappiness, however, it could also make situation worse by revealing who the carrier is, in the family. The question given is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should be obligated to tell his or her relatives and I think that the carrier should not be obligated to do so because I belive that he or she has right not to know.\n",

Of course, some people may do it to make their futures slightly happier, however, the carrier, before the testing, can choose not to go for the test and simply live with unknowns and accept the facts. If he chooses to live in the uncertainty that the gene holds and willing to accept it, he could do that, and it has been something that is 'normal' to everyone in the past as gentic testing was not possible. It could rather be better for him or her this way.\n",

I personally think this ist he right purpose of going through the genetic testing, so that a family who cannot afford to have a disabled kid do not have to give birth to their child and make the entire family suffer. However, I belive that the carrier has right not to obligate to tell anyone but has responsibility to take an action to prevent any ethical dilemma. If the result turned out something that the carrier cannot accept then it would have been better not knowing the truth.\n",

Any individual at risk for a disorder has the right to undergo genetic testing, but whether the results should be informed to others, especially close family or relatives, is the topic that worth discussing. This is an issue need to be addressed as family-related ethical dilemma is involved. In this essay, few arguments will be pointed out in the support of view for any carrier of that known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives.\n",

              "When we were born, we were surrounded by our family and relatives, with them welcoming us to this new world. We were crying hard but we are not alone, it's our family and relatives that grow us up. Hence, they should be the people be grateful for and the people we would like to share the joy together. However, in the case pertaining to any health issue or to the extent of serious disorder, it may seems no point of sharing but this involves more than just sharing of bad news. One definitely has the right to disclose his or her health issues to anyone, but it's also one's responsibility to inform the family and close relatives. As the case of health issue is related to genetic risk, with keyword on \"genetic\" which highlights the risk of passing down the disorder to the next generation. Therefore, I would agree to that it's obligated for a carrier of known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives to avoid any family-related ethical dilemma that could be raise up in the future.\n",

By doing so, one will feel less stressful in facing such disorder risk. Relatives will certainly be supportive and show more caring towards the carrier of a known genetic risk. By informing them, the carrier is never alone in fighting the battle of such disorder risk.\n",

This would avoid the rise of more family-related ethical dilemma.\n",

In conclusion, in order to avoid the family-related ethical dilemma, it is best for any carrier of known genetic risk to inform his/her relatives. The benefits of doing so are able to outweigh its disadvantages. More supports must be provided through different means to give better direction when one is standing of such junction whether should him/her to inform the relatives.\n",

However, it leads to a new problem that \"should a carrier of a known genetic risk be obligated to tell his or her relatives?\" This issue has been discussed for a long time. However, there is still a diversity of point of views among the people. Thus, we are going to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the issue which is \"should or should not\".\n",

Frequently, the intention of the carriers does not want to tell their families are to continue their own life without the anxious of families. It is obvious that there will be better for one person to be worried than many.\n",

That is the most essential elements to overcome the challenges.\n",

Lying on the bed for the remaining life, and even die immediately, these are the consequences which we cannot imagine. Families are our dearest in our life. Without their concern and support, we are hard to stay until this time. They play the important role in our life which cannot be substituted. A known genetic risk can also affect our next generation critically. Therefore, it is our responsibility to tell the relatives to prevent the occurrence of undesired consequences.\n",

We cannot blame them that they are liable to the undesired consequences. However, hospital can provide a councilor to advice the carrier about the action can be taken. Therefore, this kind of circumstances will not be happened again and again. It is a method that benefits two parties which is a win-win situation.\n",

Carrier is responsible to balance his or her own interest and the benefits of family and even society. It is a hard decision to make but with the most appropriate way, it will create great circumstances for the carrier and families in the future.\n",

With the nature that the results will be known once the tests are done, each individual that is diagnosed to be a genetic risk carrier face an ethical problem: They should warn their relatives about the risking of being the same genetic risk carrier. Or they can choose to keep silent until the next carrier is diagnosed. In the view of my point, a carrier of a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives, with the support of the following reasons.\n",

This diagnosis can be regarded as a kind of privacy to carriers. They may do not want this truth to influence their life or want to keep it as a secret and do not others know about it. This is reasonable since the exposure of the truth of being a carrier may make them be discriminated or sympothized by others which is not positive factors brought to their life.\n",

When people want to check whether they are genetic risk carriers, they can go and approach a doctor to consult about it. If they do not want to think too much of it and view it as a trouble, they may just ignore the possibility. However, if a dignosed carrier is obligated to tell his or her relatives, the relatives will be forced to know their higher chance of being genetic risk carriers. This obeys their own willingness as in they have to accept the truth which may make their following life miserable.\n",

However, this is not exactly true when other factors including psychological influence, social influence, are taken into consideration. If one such relative is told that he or she may have higher risk of getting sick, he or she may have be scared about the unknown life, partners, spouse and colleagues may choose to leave, and many other situations may happen which means the relative's life may be ruined. On the other side, as stated above, a person who want to confirm and has been prepared to face the result can choose to do the genetic testing individually.\n",

Otherwise, making it an obligation will restric the choice of carriers and bring a lot of confusion to their relatives.\n",

Many syndromes such as Down Syndrome and Taylor Syndrome can be prevented to happen if the mother undergo proper medication and don't consume harmful goods during the pregnancy period. This information may not be known by the mother if she doesn't tell her relatives regarding her condition. More people (relatives) know her problem, more information channel is provided. If all efforts have been made but the children still suffer from the syndrome then the family have to accept this fact and do whatever they can to bring a good environment for their children's growth. This is not the parent's fault because there is still chances of the gene being inherited. So, they have to also prepare mentally.\n",

Unlike people with high proportion of skin pigment, people with albinism is prone to sunburn and other skin diseases. If they don't treat their body well, such as by using sunglasses or wearing sunscreen in outdoor, the chances are good that they will get skin problems that may also lead to cancer. Once you suffer from cancer, the medication cost is very expensive. To prevent the bigger problem to happen, it takes a lot of effort to take care of your body. If the carrier doesn't tell his or her relatives, it may be too late to get their support and prepare financially.\n",

Usually people are not aware if they carry the sickle cell gene and this may lead to circulatory problem such as blood blocking. If the parents know that one of them is a carrier and disclose the information to their relatives then they can bring their children to undergo genetic testing and don't need to be shy of it because it is for the sake of their children's health.\n",

People and friends often mock of your conditions. A strong mental condition and conviction must be build from within and from the closest ones. If not their family then who else that are willing to do that? It is not a heavy job for the family if they have prepare their mental first by disclosing the information of the probability that their children may suffer from the genetic disorder.\n",

              "In this modern world, the technologies were improved a lot compared with the last century. Particularly, in the medical field, there is a great improvement in many treatments for many formally incurable diseases, and genetic testing is one of the methods which were used to diagnose an individual at risk for a genetic disorder. The medical authorities claimed that only the individual who is at risk for a genetic disorder can make the decision to undergo genetic testing. However, once a test has been conducted and the results are known, a family-related ethical dilemma is born. The question is whether a carrier of a known genetic risk should tell his or her relatives.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In my opinion, the carrier of a known genetic risk has to tell his or her relatives about this. This is because his or her relatives have the right to know about this. As many people realize, a genetic disorder can be related to the carrier's relatives, that is, one of the family members is at risk for a genetic disorder means that other family members also have almost the equally risk to have it, so this problem should be treated seriously by the family. Every family member has their human right to know what is going on with them. If they do not even know that they are at risk for a genetic disorder, how can this explain their right? For instance, John is informed by his doctor that he is at risk for a genetic disorder but he does not tell his sibling, James about this. Although telling James about this is horrible to some extent, he should know what will be likely to be going on for him. This might be beneficial for his future if he is aware of the risk of having this disorder.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "The next point is that telling relatives can raise their awareness of having the similar genetic disorder, preventing certain genetic disorders to affect themselves. Genetic disorders are innate, but the great improvement of medical treatment makes it possible for humans to prevent the disorder or to reduce the negative effects of the disorder on themselves. In addition, doctors usually quote a statement, \"Prevention is better than curation\"; this gives us an idea that preventing a disorder to happen has far more advantages than curing it. Awareness of having a genetic disorder may help in diagnosing a genetic disorder for a person, and therefore, this may make the prevention of a certain disorder possible. For example, hypertension is partially due to genetic factors, but environmental factors also play an important role. People who aware of having such disorder can prevent the disorder to happen by adapting a healthy lifestyle, including having a balanced diet and at least having exercise for 30 minutes every day.\n",

              "Together with the advancement of technology over past decades,medical advancement has increased exponentially and further enhancements are still constantly upgrading.Empower doctors with advance medical knowledge,doctors are able to diagnose and undergo genetic testing for patients to help them prevent and take necessary steps to protect their life.However, once a test has been conducted and the results are known,a question of disclosing the results to his or her relatives become a challenging issue to both patient and doctor.In my opinion,I feel the strong urge to support the obligation to inform patient relatives.\n",

              "As it is a genetic risk,the patient next-of-skin might have a high chance of carrying the risk,hence the need to inform their relatives is important so that necessary prevention actions could be taken before unforeseen circumstances might occur.For example,if you are the only child in a family and unfortunately,you are suffering from a genetic disease that the genetic trait might be passed on to your next generation if you have a child,hence by letting your family members aware of the situation,it would lessen family stresses and suffering on forcing you to settle down and have children.However, social ethic issues like discrimination and privacy are biggest concerns and potential barriers to enforce patients or doctors to disclose information to patients relatives.It challenges the confidentiality and privacy principles.Currently, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996(HIPAA) in the United States,there is no legal obligation requirement to disclose information to relatives,it is up to the patient's wish to disclose to their family members.Early disclosement to family members brings in positive reaction and prevention,as in the case of Angelina Jolie,she chose to disclose information and underwent treatment to reduce the risk of breast cancer significantly to under five percent.I still can recall her reason for disclosing her own story was that she does not want to live under the shadow of cancer.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "However,there are still people against the decision of revealing private information.As in the case of Alzheimer patients,it is up to the patient's own choice to disclose information.However,research has shown that doctors have tried to interpret who,how and whom will Alzheimer disease be disclosed to minimise potential negative impact to families members (DementiaToday,2012).There are associations provide helps to Alzheimer patients like Alzheimer's Association (Alzheimer's Association,1980).Although there are still thousand of genetic risk diseases out there that might not be receiving all helps and supports from everyone,the needs to receive immediate understanding and support from family members is an utmost help that patients need in their difficult time.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In conclusion,the state should have passed a legal bill to measure and provide information to doctors that till which extend should a doctor opt to reveal to relatives members about the genetic disease and in which situations it is open to patient's decision.In addition,the state could also encourage to create assistance schemes to aid necessary help to needy patients to encourage them to open up for the benefit of own and family members.Although it may face challenges from social ethic issues,in a long term,with appropriate encouragement and aid from the government,more individuals would have a different view of acceptance and take appropriate measurements to protect their own health and their loved ones.\n",

              "Nowadays, the study in the genetic field has gone further and further due to the high-velocity technological advancement. Not long ago, the human genome project sponsored by several large multinational corporations (MNCs) has been started. In comparison, in the field of genetic testing which enables people to be aware of the risk of a possible genetic disorder, as the technology has been very mature already, an even more popular topic arises. While most people agree that each individual has his own right to decide whether to undergo a genetic test or not, they have different stands in whether it is the patient's responsibility or freedom to share the result with his or her relatives. In my opinion, the patients, which are carriers of some known genetic risk are supposed to share the truth with their family members.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Admittedly, it is a social obligation to be responsible for the life of other people. To the whole society, it is a duty. Take H1N1 as an example, all the people in Singapore including students at school, travelers at the Changi Airport, workers in the office as well as passengers on the street are forced by law to take their temperature and report the result to the relevant government authority in charge. To those family members who care about them, it is also a moral obligation. How can they not tell their loved ones who they really are and get their loved ones in danger? The basis of a family is that everyone trusts and love each other with no doubts. Without trust and love, there is no difference between a family and a bunch of strangers living together. Hence, it is essential to tell their family members about the risk of their genetic disorder both as a social responsibility and a favor to conserve the family basis.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "Moreover, telling their family members the truth is the fastest and easiest way to get their support. Without the support of loved ones, patients' life is no better than death. Family members, as one the closest group of people from whom they can get comfort, is a crucial factor for them to successfully get over any possible troubles as a result of genetic disorder. A study of New York University in 2010 shown that patients with family members around generally recovers 2-4 days faster than those taken care by professional nurses. Even for those patients with terminal diseases, the duration of their survival is 30% longer due to the family support. Some people may say that telling the truth may arise some unnecessary doubts and panics which will endanger the family harmony. While every family need to go through this or that kind of troublesome situations, the more troubles that a family has gone through together, the greater bond will be established between the family members as well as the greater amount of trust, love and understanding. Hence, for a family in which every member is truly believing in each other and loving each other ,all these troubles are just testaments to make them stronger. Just as the lyrics of Kelly Clarkson, what doesn't kill you make you stronger.\n",

The courage to take the genetic testing and yet to inform their relatives about the risk that they may have may result in people being judgmental while actually it is just a risk and not a confirmed case. Furthermore, since it is the person's gene that is affected, he has the right to determine with whom he wants to share the information with. Nevertheless, while I fell that a carrier should not be obligated to tell his or her relatives about the genetic risk, I would like to suggest the person to at least share the information with her or his potential partner (husband or wife) since the individual's genetic risk may affect their future children.\n",

              "Many people in our society are not well informed about many genetic diseases and many of them will most likely to judge or at least differentiate those who have genetic diseases since they feel that the patients are abnormal or 'weird'. This is because many relate genetic diseases to those such as Bubble-Boy disease, autism or down-syndrome. In those diseases, many who are affected do actually have different physical characteristics compared to those without the genetic diseases. While we do know that we should not discriminate them based on their limitations, many people still do it with or without them realizing it. In this particular case, we are discussing about whether a person should tell his relatives about him having a RISK of a particular genetic disease. It is normal for people to demand for a fair and similar treatment as the others and therefore it is normal for people to try to keep some of their secrets or personal issues to themselves in case some people judge them or treat them differently.Many people really love to hear what they want to hear and therefore they may just ignore the word 'risk' and assume that the person has suffered from the disease. To prevent that from happening, I do feel that it is up to the person whether he wants to share the information with his family since his family may either be paranoid or judge him and act differently. Especially when it is just a risk, the option is really his since he is not an actual sufferer.\n",

May be we can trust our immediate family members but can we really trust all the other relatives? Furthermore, since the genetic risk or genetic disease is a very personal case, it is up to the person's call to tell the relatives about it.\n",

This information needs to be at least acknowledged by the other party before they make the decision to get married and have children. There may be possibilities when both the husband and wife are carriers and therefore they should not have any child since their child may not be able to survive even after they are born. Or in a less extreme case, the child may be disabled. This piece of information does play a role in family planning matters, therefore although no one is obliged to tell about their genetic risk to anyone, it should be encouraged to tell it to their future partner.\n",

The child with genetic risk may not have the ability to work, to build up the family with the others and most of the time they are not acceptable for the majority. They may not able to enjoy a normal people can enjoy. This competitive world is cruel to those are not able to survive. Parents and relatives have to work longer than expected and endlessly to foster their child if he/she is not able to foster himself/herself. The situation may become worst if the child has diseases like cancer or heart disease, which means that parents have another heavy baggage named medication fees. Not only the child but also the entirely family will suffer. It is still early for parents to decide whether they can foster a new life that are not able to work and may suffer the pain in the entire life.\n",

There are always newspaper report that a new born baby has be abandoned at hospital after they realized the baby have diseases that need a huge amount of money to secure. For the countries like Singapore, they are short of manpower to contribute to the nation. However, every year the government has to spend a lot to help the disables such as medical subsidizes and builds up special schools to educate them. Without increasing number of disables in a nation, the government is able to concentrate to develop in other ways like military and education. As citizens of a nation, they have the responsibility to support their country in many ways. Moreover, in the world we are living today, many miscarriages conducted in hospital every day. It is easier for people to accept it morally. Therefore I believe the parents have their right to know the healthiness of their child.\n",

However, the problem is, will the people really enjoy their life if they have to stay at hospital everyday and with all the needles and endless pain? Parents know what the best is for their children, thus they will make a right decision after they have be informed. Also, human being should improve the medical field in order to prevent the tragedy happen.\n",

They have the right to know whether they are at risk. Also, telling them the result can let them largely reduce the cost for multiple testing . They can also take immediate measures to reduce the possibility of having this disease. If person has a disease C that might be a result of gene A. He runs a test and know that he has the gene AA. This means both of his parents has gene A and they are both under high risk of having disease C. They could save the cost of runing two separate tests to see whether they are under high risk of having disease C. If he runs a test and know that he has the gene Aa. This means one of his parents has gene A and one cost of testing could be saved. His relatives can then take measures, if this disease can some how be prevented, to stop this disease from taking their lives. However, this can also be achieved from personal choice. One can choose to tell their relatives if they are at risk. Most people care about their relatives, if there is no serious consequence of telling them so, I assume most of them will tell their relatives to be careful. One might also choose to hint or encourage their certain relatives to run a gene test if they are concerned about negative consequences that comes across when they disclose their genetic results.\n",

If a person is obliged to tell his/her relatives, he or she might be discriminated by those who do not carry this gene. He or she might even be adviced not to get married or have children. For example, if an unmarried person has gene Aa and gene aa is sufficient for a very seriou disease. After he takes the test and be obliged to tell his relatives, everyone know that he is a carrier. So all the married couples go run a test and know they are not carriers.They might subconsiously see him as different and worry that he will find a wife who will carry this gene as well.\n",

If that is a big family, is he obliged to tell everyone? Spouses usually have very close relationships, if person A tell his family that he has this gene, his uncle C knows and tells his wife D that he needed to run a test because his cousine has this disease. However wife D is not even under the risk of having this disease. Then wife D might tell her mother, who likes to gossip on her way to the theatre. In less than a week half of the town knows person A has a risked gene, and his family might be a genetically risked family. Then nobody wants to marry A, or his relatives. This is the potential consequence if one does not have full control of his/her information, especially when the party that he is obliged to disclose his information to is a potentially large group (relatives).\n",

              "Nowadays, people not only pursuit the comfort of their own life but also a better development of their following generations. Since the technology of modern society has been so advanced, it becomes possible for people to make decision to take genetic test so as to be clear whether or not they carry genetic risk which can affect their next generation. The debatable question, an ethical dilemma, is that are people responsible for telling their relatives that they carry a known genetic risk? In my opinion, the responsibility of telling family and relatives is quite obvious. And there are two basic reasons. The first one is the importance of being responsible for your self-wellness and health of your relatives and the second one is being responsible for the next generations.\n",

Because if you are carrying that genetic risk, then there is great possibility that your relatives like parents or siblings are carrying the same genetic risk as well. The genetic risk that you carry may or may not affect your health and put you in danger. If you haven't undergone the genetic testing, it's just odd and fate for what will happen to both of you and your relatives. However, if you have undergone and known that you are a carrier, you are responsible for your whole family. Even though you cannot eliminate the risk completely, you can at least try to be alert to avoiding getting the disease. As for those in your family who are more likely to be affected, they can go to the hospital to do the checks regularly. Therefore, telling the families and the relatives to get prepared for fighting the disease and even prevent to get the disease is your responsibility.\n",

If your wife is not aware of the truth and give birth to the baby, it will be possible for your child to carry the same genetic risk as well. Being the parent, you are not responsible to you next generations, since you allow the genetic risk to be passed on by generation and generation and being aware of it. However, if you tell the truth to your wife and relatives, you offer a chance about whether to have child or not. And if you still decide to have the baby, since the technology has been developed so advanced, it might be possible in the future that the application of altering gene is perfected and widely used, you can then choose to give birth to babies by giving them a brighter future. This is the responsibility of being a parent. And in my opinion, this seems to be the main purpose of undergoing that genetic testing at the first place.\n",

              "Genetic testing will be conducted when the individual is at risk of some possible disease. Once the test is done, whether the results should be open to his or her relatives has caused social extensive controversy. Some say it is a kind of invasion of privacy for the carrier and should be protected. He or she has the right not to tell anyone. However, in my opinion, it is the obligation of a carrier of a known genetic risk to tell his or her relatives about his or her actual situation. This essay will illustrate in two aspects.\n",

              "First of all, it can be an alert for the family members of the patient and let them be aware of the possible disease that they may also have. As we all know, genetic risk carriers are likely to pass the genetics to their family members. Once one person in the family is found to be carrying risky genetic, other members in his or her family may also have the risk of disease. Some of the diseases may not show symptoms until the carrier is old enough. Therefore, telling the relatives about the situation may avoid a lot of trouble in this way and save much time for proper treatment. Sometimes life may even be saved if they are told early and conduct timely treatment. So for the consideration for the other family members, the relatives should be informed.\n",

              "Secondly, it can avoid genetic disease passed to the next generation when they intend to have babies. They should let their spouse know about his or her situation before marriage. They need to ask for doctor's advice before they plan to have a baby. Some genetic gene will pass only to boys rather than girls, some are on the contrary. If the carrier refuses to tell the truth to his or her spouse, another life may have risk of inheriting the genetic disease. I noticed a real story on newspaper years ago. A couple in China have a son of 5 years old. Their son unfortunately fell ill and he was diagnosis a kind of genetic disease which is very serious. They were told that the wife's family was carrying the polygenetic disorder and can pass only to boys rather than girls. Therefore their son was inherited the genetic disease. However, the wife actually had already known about the polygenetic disorder before the marriage and she did not tell her husband. The son was died after one year's treatment and the couple got divorced later after that. If the wife had not hind the truth and asked for doctor's advice before they have baby, the tragic would not happen.\n",

On the one hand, it can tell members of the carrier's family the possible disease they may have and can perform treatment in time if possible. On the other hand, it may pass the disease to the next generation if the carrier hides the truth.\n",

However, I thought that the genetic information is one person's personal privacy which should be protected by the law. Therefore, I thought a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives. There are three reasons as follows.\n",

Other people should not be told without the person's permission even though they are his or her family or relatives. The government should set the law to protect this kind of privacy. Once people's genetic information is told to other people. They may know the person's potential disabled disease or other bad things naturally. They may set a bias on this person even abandon his or her. People do not have the ability to choose their gene, they should not be thought badly because of bad gene. So I think whatever the genetic is or whether the gene is match with their parents, it should not be told to anyone even his or her family or relatives.\n",

Once his or her family or relatives know that the person does not have the relation with them. However happy they were before, there would be some barrier appears which will truly destroy the family gradually. The relationship between the parents and their children should not be tested only in the genetic way; it is something much deeper and tighter. The parents give knowledge and love to the children, meanwhile they feel happy with the accompany of the children. The children rely the parent to live. When they grow up, they take care of the old parents and thank for their dedication. The relation between parents and children is something about love and dedication. Everyone does not want to see the scene of the broken family due to the carrier of a known genetic risk. Therefore, I think a known genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives without the person's permission.\n",

Therefore I think a know genetic risk should not be obligated to tell his or her family or relatives.\n",

However, there rises a family-related ethical dilemma if it is right to tell a carrier's family once the test has been conducted and the results are known. I am most inclined to believe that his or her relatives have the rights to know the result.\n",

Though it is said that genetic testing involves emotional and social risks due to the test results, while the potential negative impacts of the risk still exist, the consequence will be significant if other members of his or her family do not know. Then they are unable to have a suitable method to protect themselves and emotional preparations. Taking Angeline Jolie for example, she is famous but she still revealed the truth about her genetic testing on the development of her breast cancer risk.

In addition, though it can be possible in some cases that he or she and the family can undergo specific discrimination in employment and their social life, how people can face more dramatic tragedy such as sickness or death if they cannot even overcome this harsh situation. Life is hard but people cannot blame it on being unfair. It is just because that you do not become strong enough to overcome the hard time.\n",

In addition, emotional preparations and the ways you explain your genetic condition is also important so that you can convey the correct information to your family and relatives and if necessary to guide them if he/she wish to conduct a similar genetic testing.\n",

I started invoving into Facebook one years ago,when I just arrived singapore. And now I got over 500 friends on Facebook and buried myself with hundrends of seeds every day. We know each others' status, changements and so on through the social media. For an example, if we change our contact numbers, we will not send SMS to each of individual any longer. Instead, we will post a seed and tag our friends to inform this kind of changments. And if you are not on it, you will just get lost.\n",

We discuss every thing we like and we have more personal space.Our friends also got more access to know what we are doing and what we like. And also, we get a chance to talk to public people like popular stars and know their life better. In China, a lot of government organizations have open blogs to communicate with people, like firefighters, police stations and so on. Socia media allows them to explain to or inform people what is going on. And actually lots of rescuing jobs are done with the help of social media like looking for people get lost and so on. With more convinient and humanian communications, the relationship between government and people get largely improved. What's more, various of cultures can be shown to us through social medias. We can know more news and cultures through socia medias. From this scope, social media has shorten our distance.\n",

And even we gather together more people find themselves has less topics to talk than before and choose to digging from their social media again. When we are far away, social media makes it as we are infront of each other; sometimes when we are by each others' side, we are seem to be further than far away.

For those who lives within the community should at least meet up, and not use social media as the primary source of communcation with each other.

              "Recently, the rise of social media helped people to have more closer connection with each other, it is a more convenient and cheaper way to have online contact compared with face to face meetings. In my opinion, social media websides such as Twitter and Facebook will not affect the chance for people to have face to face contact and thus negatively affects interpersonal skills. On the other hand, it may even increase the chance of having face to face contacts amoung people.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "First, social media networks have a lot user base, it helps to link people from different parts of the world. In the days without the social networks, people may not have the chance to know others from different countries or the ones they never meet before. Their number of people that they know may only limited to the people they meet in daily life like classmates and working partners. Therefore, social networks brings more and more connections between people and they may have a chance to chat with people they never known before, and this helps to develop the interpersonal skills as well.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "Secondly, although social network takes time for people to chat online but not face to face, they may still decide a time online to meet others face to face in the daily life. In this case, the social network helps people to increase the frequency of talk. For example, if social network does not exist, the business people need to meet each other face to face and it is other time consuming, even sometimes with business that is not so important, it still takes a lot time on travel which is a wastage. However, social network helps people to meet and chat much more easier, they can even use video chat and create group chat to chat with multiple parties at the same time. Nowadays, even some companies conduct online video interview with their applicants as it saves time and cost.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "The social network may also creat some negative impacts for the people. The largest negative impact is that due to the online network, some people start to use and rely on internet every minute. They take too much time of using online social network and thus do not have time to have their daily meeting with people in their real life. It not only affect the interpersonal skills but also bad for people's health if the ones spend to much time on the social media. Secondly, social network may leak certain personal informations to the public, as the cyber environment is not perfect and not safe, people may not protect their privacy online effectively and sometimes, some people may use others personal information to deceive.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In conclusion, although the unsafe online environment, spend too much time on internet may be the potential negative factors of using online social networks. It provides people with more convenient contact environment and improve the frequency of meeting with each others. It also helps people to develop their interpersonal skills through online chating. Overall, there are more benefits than the costs.\n",

We can even know what a friend who leave thousands of miles away eat for lunch though these kinds of social media. From some points of view, social really has a lot of advantages by let us communicate with friends cheaper and more conveniently. However, its disadvantages also cannot be ingnored when you cosider it as a platform to show off and a stage for cyber crime.\n",

It can help us know more about each other. It can make people become closer as well. For example, if you find out one of your friend's favourite singer is Justin Biber through facebook, you can give him or her Justin Biber's new album or concert ticket as a birthday gift. It will be really sweet and you two will surelly become closer. In addition, social network site can help you keep in touch with friends living very far away. I met some canadian friends in Egypt. Without facebook, we may lost contact. However, thanks to facebook, I can still keep in touch with them and I know what they are doing recently as we living close to each other.\n",

              "The disadvantages of social network media are quite undeniable. A research shows that people will unconsciously hide his or her real thought when he or her say or post something that will be exposed to the public. It means that one cannot know another's real thought and personalities by reading things that he or she put on social network media. It will make him or her quite upset when they communicate in real life. In addition, with all those \"nice\" guys around on the social network website, one may neglect people surrounding him or her but just communicate with friends on facebook. It is a common scene that two people sitting next to each other seldom talk with each other but just look at their cellphone. This kind of behaviour is not good to people's psychological health according to a research. The cyber communication is quite different to face to face communication and people who depends on cyber communication too much will not get used to the real life communication. In addition, cyber relationship cannot always work in real life. With no close relationship in real life but only close cyber friends, one is more possibly to feel lonely because the physiological need of human beings is to feel the bond with others by our five senses. With the willing of people to become the best among others, social network site now become a place to show off. Some people will to post their expensive thing or the oversea places of interest they have been on the social network and get a feeling of satisfaction by doing so. It is a mental unhealth and it may trigger people especially teenagers to become material. The last but not the least , with all kinds of personal information on one's social network page, it is covenient for criminal to make use of this information to commit a crime.\n",

              "The modes of communication have been changing over the years, from letter writing to social networking. This phenomenon is caused by rapidly changing technology, which has made communication to be faster than never before. Today, social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, are relatively common within the contemporary society; and, people can communicate with each other, online or offline, on these social networking platforms. They can even make new friends over similar interests on these platforms, which will be able to connect almost everyone closely in many parts of the world. However, critics may argue that with the existence of social media sites have reduced physical human interactions among people as they will prefer sitting in front of a computer to going out and meeting new friends. This essay will discuss about both the benefits and down sides of using social media in the contemporary society.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Nowadays, social media are able to disseminate information faster than any other media. There are about 50% of the people who have learnt about breaking news from social media. This is due to people spending comparatively more time on social networking than time on reading newpapers. Furthermore, with the current technology, smartphones are able to get access to social media sites which have made easier for consumers to use. Hence, social media has benefited the masses by equipping them with a powerful tool to disseminate information almost immediate to the people around them.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "However, critics may argue that not all information or news disseminated are reliable. There might be false information or hoaxes spreading around on social media. For example, in 2012, there were false rumors of fires, shootouts, and caravans of gunmen in a Mexico City suburb which had spread through Twitter and Facebook. This had caused panic among the people who had flooded the local police department with numerous phone calls, and this had resulted temporarily closed of schools. The spreading of false information can be a potential psychological threat to everyone, given that social media can disseminate information in a realtively fast speed. Nevertheless, there are cyber polices who roam around these social networking platforms to prevent these hoaxes spreading around. But, there will still be unreliable sources spreading false information on social media sites despite high security to control almost every social networking movement.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Social media are able to improve relationship and make new friends, provided that there is mutual trust and mutual understanding between both parties. Many of the teenagers today claimed that they are able to keep in touch with their friends through social media, regardless of their location. In the past, people used to writing letters to their friends and it will take relatively long time to send the letter over. Therefore, with the help of technology, people are able to catch up wth each other conveniently. Furthermore, it will be easier to make new friends find who have simliar interests or hobbies. However, in order for people to maintain their relationship as well as making new friends, it requires mutual trust and understanding between both parties. It might not be accurate to judge the other party's feelings over social media as one may cover up their emotions while on social media. In addition, there are also chances for people to miscommunicate with each other as they cannot sense the tone of the other party over social media platforms. This will result in unnecessary conflicts between two parties over miscommunication. But, if there is trust and mutual understand on social media, it will be ideal for people to improve relationship and make new friends.\n",

              "In conclusion, social media in the contemporary society is able to help one improve relationship and make new friends, as well as, disseminate information efficiently to the masses. However, there are risks of false information and chances of miscommunication. Nevertheless, the advantages of social media will benefit the masses if the negative aspects of it can be carefully taken care of. All-in-all, social media is the product of rapid technological advancement and there are more to come in future.\n",

              "Advantages: Social media sites have greatly ease long distance communication and interaction due to its accessibility and convenience. With a globalised and interconnected world today, Twitter and Facebook are now the mainstream platform for social interaction. With just a touch away from any meida/electronic devices, one can easily interact and communicate with his friends without much hassle. Thus, long distance relationship or friendship can be maintain and keeping in touch with your circle of friends has been made much easier. With the sharing of personal photos, posting of status of one's personal feeling or experience and able to reply to these posts allowed human interaction to be engage and expand with ease. Introverts or those who are shy to communicate with their friends are now able to do so in the form of words via social media platform. Thus, socialisation can occur seamlessly and effectively with the utilisation of such social media platforms.Meet-ups and appointments are no longer a barrier for humans to contact and communicate with one another, making human interaction possible at one's own convenience. The society will adapt to such phenomenon as physical interaction are transformed into cyber interaction. With the frequent usage and reliance of the social media and the Internet, a society that socialises through the cyber will be more advance and adapted to the highly connected world. This will greatly help a society to progress rapidly.\n",

              "Disadvantages: One of the main concerns of using social media platform to communicate is credibility. The certainty of what is being shared or expressed could not be proven physically as media limits this physical interaction, except when using a webcam to chat. We cannot be certain for sure the reliabilty or truth of some posts or information we received through the Inetrnet. We may in actual fact communicating with a hoax Facebook acccount of a cyber friend, which we assume to be real but in reality, it is a fake account. Photos and informations retrieved from their profile page may be fabricated to suit certain personal agenda. Thus, the lack of face-to-face human contact through social media restricts actual interaction which can be stimulated through the media. Although emocons can be used to show certain emotion, this differs from the real authentic emotion of your friends when you observed them through their body language and their facial expression. The danger of such media socialisation is the uncertainty of such communication due to lack of physical interaction. Furthermore, this lack of physical interaction has affected human inter-personal behaviour since communication is made through social media instead of meet-ups. This lowers the experience of human ability to interact with one another which can adversely shape one's behaviour. The lack of exposure to real life interaction with humans with not create the confidence and skills needed for one to interact seamlessly and effectively with others. Therefore, for an effective and efficient society, there is a need to have a balance of both social media interaction and face-to-face human interaction within its people.\n",

People use Twitter to follow the artiste or celebrity they love and Facebook to see what is their friends' recent activity. Nevertheless, they still can use phone to do normal call and message to contact. Not only the phone did the jobs for them, but also devices like personal computer, laptop, tablet, and many other devices which are able to connect to internet. It is obvious to see that internet saves people's time and also connect people globally. Several arguments have been made regarding the social media actually have some inevitable disadvantages to people.\n",

              "People can only use electical devices to access internet. Whenever they need to use social media, they have to use a phone or internet. Generally people need they eyes to look at the display screen of their phone or computer and fingers to manipulate the corresponding device. As a result, they will lose eyes to contact and hands to express their feeling to people nearby them, which means they have lost the tools they need for face-to-face contact communicating. This can be easily seen in restaurants or cafes nowadays. A family of four having dinners in a restaurant without any chatting, because their holding and looking at their display screen with one hand when the other hand is holding a fork. A group of friends having high tea in a café without chatting as well, because they do not know what to talk but pressing on their display screen. The children nowadays do not know what is neighbourhood games and who is staying beside them, all they know is pressing icons on the screens. These are some concrete examples of how the socia media reduce face-to-face human contact.\n",

Firstly, they have lost the courage to meet strangers, not even the courage to talk. Also, they will not have enough experience to communicate with people in face and not be trained in their conversation skills. As a result, social media helps them do the jobs but indirectly affects their interpersonal skills.\n",

A father may be able to make a call to his daughter who is in other country via socia media software instead of making international call which costs a lot to normal salary family. He can even talk to her daughter face-to-face using video call via internet. Secondly, people makes friends all over the world and able to update their friends his recent activity easily. A guy who is going travel for months can easily tell all of his friends about his activity. When one of his friends who is not aware of this has failed to contact him via telephone calls, he might be able to get his whereabout using social media. These are the advantages that save works most of the time.\n",

              "All of us are living in the technology realm society. Have you ever wondered why we use these tools to connect ourselves with other people? It started withthe invention of technology which has evolved tremendously over the past few decades. In the past, we travel by ship and now we can use airplane to do so. In the past, it took a few days to receive a message as we need to post our letter and now, we can use e-mail which stands for electronic message to send messages to our friends or even use our handphone to send our messages. From the example that I have mentioned earlier we can see that distance between us and our loved one are getting further apart. This is because by the ease of technology such as airplane, some of our friends might be going overseas to continue their studies or even you are away from your family to pursue your studies or even careers in life. Thus, this makes Twitter and Facebook become one of the medium that we need. Nevertheless,everything in life has positive and negative effects. This is applicable to these social media sites. The next two paragraphs will be discussing about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our society.\n",

              "With the help of social media tools , we can stay in contact and keep ourselves up to date with our family and friends even though we are away from them. Social media sites such as Facebook has allow us to share our pictures or even chat online with our parents while we are overseas. This approaches help the parents to communicate with their children and know what kind of activities that their children have when they are overseas. The social media is beneficial as it connect you and your loved one even though you are separated by the distance. It might not be able to replace the joy that you have when you are with your family but it could help to reduce the sadness of being away from your family.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "As I mentioned in the beginning, there is also disadvantages of social media tools. One of them is that it reduce the level of concentration especially among the youngsters. This is because it is part of everyone's habit to check their facebook's page as their friends will post something new every second. Thus, you can see that some students will browse facebook while attending lectures. This means that the students are not concetrating when they supposed to do so. As a result, it could affect their lives and studies. This will then could lead to stress as these students are not able to cope with their studies because they were distracted.\n",

In increasingly globalised world, such platforms even enhances and compliccates the links between indivduals in the world. Thanks to them, people can get to know one another online, without having to travel to meet up for business purposes for companies or personal reasons. However, it is also bringing some social changes whereby such virtual worlds are overtaking the real-life world, resulting in some negative impacts in individuaul's daily lives and therefore becoming a large problem in societies as a whole.\n",

As people feel more confident online where they do not have to face in real-life on the spot, they feel more comfortable and thus prefer communicating online. This results in lack of interpersonal skills in individual, especially young students as they always have option to turn their back to the real-life and go online. This becomes a huge problem when they have no choice but have to face things in real life. As they are so used to having an online avatar, they may lose their self-identity in real life and may not realise how to interact people in real-life.\n",

The reason why it is so addictive is, that the more people get into the social media, they seek attention from their friends. However, such sparks of sudden attention is extremely short-termed and gone eaily thus does not add any value or meaning to the user's life. Also, according to a research, it has been proven that the users feel more sad after using the Facebook and this is because users unknowingly compare their lives with other people's lives. But seriously, most people only post the happiest moments in their lives.\n",

Indeed, I myself use Facebook just because of the friends' contacts that I want to keep. However, the friendship on such virtual world is so superficial which is not so relevant to the real-life. Also, as numerous profit-driven companies realize the hugh human traffic on such social media sites, they make it as a pond to fish the customers by uploading many advertisements. Furthermore this also possibly triggers the privacy issues as the Facebook allows some other profit-driven companies to have access to the information on the users. As this happens, users are more and more pron to any possible frauds.\n",

The idea seems great, and nowadays most people even the older generation will have at least one social media platform like Facebook. The parents are now the \"friends\" of their kids, and they can now \"follow\" their kids more closely and on real time. People post about their random thoughts or daily activities via Twitter and post different kinds of photos on Facebook frequently, to be connected with their so called friends. However, as we then tend to spend too much time on this and have significantly reduced in face-to-face human contact, that eventually affects our interpersonal skills.\n",

As a student, I tend to meet lots of people from different background and at different settings. We may meet only once but we exchange our contact numbers as well as facebook account in order to keep in touch. Unlike just keeping contact numbers that we may not even call, social media like facebook is a great way for friends from different field or even from different parts of the world to be connected. Within clicks, we could check on the friend's profile and read on for his/her updates. On another hand, we could update our profile by posting on the wall and our friends could read up on the newsfeed. This allows friends that may not have the time for meet up to still connected in a way. Not only that, new friends can be easily met through such online platforms. Hence, our social circle is indeed expanding.\n",

This subsequently leads to the poor interpersonal skills that inhibit the growth of our real social circle. For example, we tend send a birthday wishes when Facebook promts us \"Today is someone's birthday\". In fact, we may have just forgotten our friend's birthday. We used to send wishes cards during festive season like Chinese New Year, and we feel so good to write one and of course to receive one with stamps on it. Gone were the times, and now we do mass sending and the receiver may feel less meaning in such online wishes. As time passed, we may have more \"friends\" on the list, but the meaning of friends needs to be redefined.\n",

Ultimately, the best way to enhance interpersonal skills is still through face-to-face meetings but social media sites are only the tools to enhance it.\n",

Whether we are at home or at school, at work or on a holiday, we are able to communicate and interact with our friends. Even when people are thousands of miles apart, social media make it possible to have interaction by keep writing comments. When our phones are accidentally done, we can also use the social media to get contact with our friends. Some people who are try to talk in the public can also actively take part in the group chatting via social media. Besides, we can make more friends by such interactions when our friends also bring their friends in. Therefore, the popularity of social media sites have made it more convenient for people ot update friends' status and contact with friends more frequently.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "On the other side, we need to rethink about the influences brought by the social media. There are still many disadvantages of using social media. Firstly, interpersonal skills may be affacted by the reduction in face-to-face human contact. While social media brings convenience to people life, people are more and more willing to use social media for chatting instead of face-to-face chatting which has a time and place requirement. People who are not good at public chatting may be more reluctant to talk to people, and their interpersonal skills can never be improved under this situation. Secondly, people's over-addition may avoidably, to some degree, exacerbate social alienation, and this kind of alienation causes some social media users to suffer from the over-dependence of virtual social networking. More and more networking has been transferred to internet from real life. This is a potential danger for teenagers who are growing with social changes to get hurt. Thirdly, a lot of updating of luxury living standard as well as other show-off situations may make people's daily life more and more grandiloquent, which is not an accurate social growing trend. Lastly, it is easy for people to waste a lot of time using social media. Again, there is a trend for them to suffer from social media addition and their study and work may be greatly influenced.\n",

              "Since we can see both advantages and disadvantages of using social media, and we cannot deny the huge benefits that have been brought to us, this main trend of using social media may be still lasting for a long time. Therefore, everytime when we use social media, we should take both sides into consideration and try to avoid be affected by the disadvantages. Only by absorbing the essence and discarding the dregs can we make better use of the social media.\n",

Through Facebook, peope are able to maintain relationship with their old acquaintances. This benefit cannot be obtained through telephone or mail because people's particular and address may change from time to time while on Facebook, people can keep in contact with old friends just by using name and photo, for example, as the identifier. Facebook is like a combination of message and chatting service, personal profile, media of sharing, and other entertainment add-on (i.e. social games) which allow users to communicate with remote people, and also to update and express themselves at the same time.\n",

For Facebook, a comprehensive way of sharing is offered since multiple photos and videos can be uploaded, long notes can be published, even documents and data can be shared through Facebook nowadays. These advantages also comes in handy as most of these social media sites are accessible through mobile application in our smartphones.\n",

Researches show that face-to-face meeting frequency among people that are addicted to social media sites has been decreasing. As the consequence, it affects their interpersonal skills. People can think while typing and prepare what they want to say but in face-to-face communication, every word that comes out of your mouth and may be not well arranged is the picture of your personality. This skill requires practices and cannot be done completely through social media.\n",

These social media serves a purpose to bind people in spite of their geographical boundaries but it doesn't mean that surrounding people are neglected as the payoff. This is related to the interpersonal skill that is mentioned before, that can be decreasing qualitatively if we are used to facing gadget, not facing human being.\n",

Because of this, other people start to think that our lives are full of happiness with no problem at all. Other people then are influenced by us and tend to do the same. As a result, people think of theirselves lowly and may lead to depression and mental disorder. It also reduces our sympathy. This is a serious social problem and affects a lot of people.\n",

Many people think that the social media sites have benefits on the communication between people while some others argue that there are several negative impacts for the society.\n",

              "One of the advantages which are carried by those social media sites is that they can connect us more closely than before. In the past decades, when the social media sites are not yet fully developed, people connect with others who live far away by using a phone, or even a letter. However, calling a person by using a phone and writing a person a letter require some cost, and sending a letter to a person who live far away, especially in villages, takes much time. The appearance of those social media sites causes those problems to be solved. People connecting through the social media sites can spend no money on the communication, and also take only one or a few seconds for the message to reach. Therefore, this advantage of social media sites saves money and time, and also provides convenience for many people.\n",

As we graduate from a school, we will probably lose contact with some of our friends. Some of them may have changed their phone numbers and addresses, and we are not able to find them through a phone or a letter. If phone and letter are the only way to contact them, we would probably not able to find them. Facebook and Twitter can serve as an alternative route to make connection between us and our old friends. Hence, the social media sites serves as a platform for the connection.\n",

The advancement of those social media sites makes people so rely on them that some of them rather prefer using those sites to contact each other than talking to each other face to face. Many people argue that this is the most serious problem brought by social media sites. The usage of social media sites indirectly causes a reduction in face-to-face human communication in real life, which will in turn cause the lost of interpersonal skills for many people. As we all know, the interpersonal skills are essential for us to communicate with each other and to present our views and ideas. The lost of interpersonal skills results in the inability for people to well present their ideas. As a result, they will gradually decrease in their ability to compete with each other in the society.\n",

Some of the famous examples would be social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. With an increasing users of more than billion users from all over the world, social media sites have demonstrated clearly its success in playing an important part of our life. However, there are arguments that social media life brings in a reduction in face-to-face human contact, which in turn affects interpersonal skills. Let's examine the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life and society.\n",

All users' needs are an internet connection and an email account so that everyone can have a Facebook or Twitter ID to start their journey in social media life. Secondly, it helps people to keep in-touch with one another. Finding old friends through Facebook, for example, is more easier than asking people around in real life. Social media helps to lessen the hassle of geographical distance and brings people closer. Thirdly, social media sites keep us up-to-date on latest news and updates from almost everywhere in the world, all with a click away on the refresh button. Last but not least, social media sites also link people together through allowing us to create our own groups, pages or sites to share our hobbies, interests and studies in particular subjects. Hence, it is undeniable that these sites play an important role in our global inter-connected world.\n",

Undeniable, it becomes more addicting when we spend more time busy socialising and interacting virtually. We spend majority of our time on sites like Facebook, Twitter and it affects our daily work productivity and performance. In corporate world, employers often block social media network to prevent employees to spend their office time on their personal leisure than concentrating on their work. Using text-messaging language as an informal way of communicating on social media network also brings in a bad impact for us in a long term. The more time we spend on these sites, the lesser time we spend on face-to-face interacting with one another. Hence it lessens valuable interaction between human and time we spend away from the computer screen or mobile phone. In addition, there are also some false reports and fake IDs occur on both social media sites that people use fake ID to insult or harass someone, like the case of Heather Chua occurred recently on Facebook. These malicious comments often go viral and it creates a strong negative effect on the real user in real life, which might lead to unwilling attitude to interact with others in real life by the victim.\n",

Since some of the information has already been revealed on the home page, it is also easier to find some common topics to talk about. Moreover, people usually like to share boldly about their real feelings online with their masks in reality being taken off. This has been indicated in a report done by Boston University in 2012, 80% of information posted online is true while a person may like 3 out of 10 times in real life. This shows that a facebook friend may know more about you than your close friend who does not have a facebook account. That is because we are acting who we are in reality while we have no reason to do that in the online virtual world. Although sometimes those genuine sharing of information may be inappropriate or even harmful, such as prevalent using of vulgarity and harsh-meaning comments, we can minimize those repercussions through strict regulations of content online.\n",

That eliminates the incomplete information disadvantage for some remote rural regions where people are less aware of what actually is happening around them. One of the examples is the 2012 riots happened in Egypt and Zambia. The idea of searching for democracy is passed from Egyptians to people in Zambia quickly through the use of social media. However, as the government controls most of the media. These social media may be tools of their campaign and manipulating the thoughts of the public. For example, in 2012 general election is Singapore, Dr Tan Chee Keong made use of facebook to spread his campaign videos to the public. Though because of this, social media is still a much fairer and more transparent online platform for the public to share ideas compared to other traditional medias.\n",

They are too busy with their way too many virtual friends and some of them neglect the feelings of their real-life friends. In this case, I have to say that to err is human. What we can do is to educate the public about the importance of their friends just by their side and teach them to manage their time well.\n",

              "Social media sites' role in connecting people around the world is undeniable. Thank to those social media, the communication among people all over the world is possible and can be done with ease. Apart from the ease of communication despite of the distance, many other advantages such as knowledge sharing and trades can be done through social media as well. Nevertheless, with those advantages, some disadvantages may appear such as reduction in face-to-face human contact which affects interpersonal skills, privacy issue, as well as some frauds that can be done through social media.\n",

              "Twitter, Facebook and Skype are some social media sites which enable us to keep in touch with our friends or family who are in other cities or countries. Through those sites we are able to talk to them, to know what their activities are and who their friends are, etc. From the surface point of view it is no doubt that these sites help us to have a better relationship with our relatives despite of the distance. The sharing of information can be done faster through social media as well, that is why nowadays many news publishers make their own social media account, for example Channel News Asia has a twitter account and will update its follower with headline news. That shows how actually news and information can be shared easily through social media. Furthermore, since many teenagers and young adults are fans of social media, these information can reach them easily without them need to watch or listen to the news reports. Due to the popularity of social media, many people start to do their business via these sites. More and more advertisements can be found on Facebook, whether it is our friends who sell their products or professional brands selling their products online, we can get to buy and contact the sellers through those sites, which can be considered as an advantage for us, the buyers.\n",

              "However, is it the same when we keep in touch with someone virtually compared to when we meet them personally? I do think there is difference in it and I believe many of us will agree. When we write or communicate virtually, we can hide our through feelings and many not become ourselves since we do not want the other party to judge us. Other than that, sometimes the message of one party cannot be delivered properly to the other one since the communication is done through written language, and thus the 'tone' of the message sent and when it is received may be different. Many people are very brave in telling people about their opinions online but in real life some of them can be very shy and not outspoken at all. This will lead to a bad inter-personal skill as well as a problem of trusts. Nowadays we cannot really trust new people whom we know from social media since we will never know whether they are even 'real'. Some people fake their identities in media sites so that they can know more people or some may even cheat others. In addition, privacy issue has become more popular nowadays since some people do not realize that they may actually share some information that they are not willing to share at the first place.\n",

Not only one but many developed and developing countries have the same picture. Some say that it is a necessary step for human revolution. Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook are popular among people in order for them to connect to others even from different countries. It also brings many negative effects such as loss of face-to-face communicating skills which is important in their working place. This essay will discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in our daily life.\n",

              "One of the significant advantages of using a popular social media site is that people can reach other easily, even without contact for a long time. In this fast pace and competitive world, people may not able to keep in touch with others. With the help of social media site, people are able to upload their new discoveries and funny scene on it and they can be updated the new information of their friends. Personally I am study in oversea, busy study life keeps me away from contact my old friend. Using a common social media site with my friends to help me know what are their statuses nowadays. And I am able to easily find a common topic when I contact them. In Singapore, many Malaysian cross the sea to work here. Many of them are busy in work and separate with their children. One of Manager in my working place has the same situation. After my Manager taught her mother how to use Facebook, she was able to upload video clips of her grandchild. Therefore my Manager would not miss the moments of her daughter's growth.\n",

It is easier for people to approach the other after knowing the information. Students can exchange their experiences in study even they are in different countries. People are able to share the culture or pretty photos online, therefore others can spread the joy with them. Thus I believe that social media sites are one of useful tool to help people known each other better.\n",

One of the disadvantage that many people concerns is that people loss the interest of face-to-face communication. Many people like to use language to pretend themselves, and lost confidence when they talk to each other. Although not everyone is good at public relationship even without the existence of the social media sites, we cannot deny that it do affect some people in their ability of interpersonal skills.\n",

              "Social media has reshaped the way of communication. In real life, we communicate with one another as equal participants. We share ideas, stories and forge friendship based on mutual respect. However, communication on social media is largely based on \"broadcasting and listening\". When we use facebook and post pictures and statuses. We are actively \"presenting\" façades of our lifes in front of others. We tend to post pictures with the best looks, status that are funny. We broadcast these facades of us to others. The images we choose to present are tentatively considered. The audience is not some specific person, but everyone we might know, or even the entire world. There is an element of seeking out for attention rather than expressing one's true opinion on social networks. On the other hand, the viewers, are not the listeners. They are just scrolling down pages of pages of pictures and statuses and see one of them which they might think it funny. It is not the broadcasters themselves they care about, but the content. This type of communication does not help forging interpersonal relationships. In real life, establishing friendship requires the all-rounded understanding in one another and the caring for one another. The latter requires face to face interaction where we can show our emotions to the other. One cannot truly understand a person with only stalking his/her facebook page where he/she carefully chooses what to present. One cannot truly show their emotions by another by texting some =) signs.\n",

              "The broadcasting and viewing model is not good for forging relationships. However, it is good for sharing information. On social media, everyone is a broadcaster and a viewer. With my social network account, I seldom read newspapers or go to news websites anymore; because I can easily read them from the status of my friends. If I am interested in politics, I can just follow some politics newspapers or public figures. I get news for sales, clothes and cosmetics from my friends. If some of my friends have horrible taste on clothes and he/she posts them often, I can simply block him/her off. Information got circulated. The most popular information get circulated the most so I can seldom miss it. Social network plays a role in providing and also filtering information. This saves a lot of time for me in reading newspapers and watching TV.\n",

              "Personally I feel more at ease on social medias. From the above two points of view I think social media could forge more interest-based friendships. With the help of social media, I become real life friends with those from online forums whom I share the same interest with. I also discover some of my friends' interest which I find common with myself so that talking to one another is much more about life, study, friends, etc. The communication does not focus on how we feel, or to say, each otherm, but whatever is interesting, or the content. In this case, interpersonal skill is not as important because our goal is not to impress somebody, but to get the information that we are both interested in.\n",

              "People that living in the modern world really cannot live without the social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. Almost all students and young adults possess the Facebook or Twitter account. It is true that social media makes people be able to connect one another more conveniently. However, it seems that, especially for some those, sharing some parts of their lives such as videos and photos on the social media sites become really necessary. An extremely interesting and ironic phenomenon was discovered that a group of friends met and sat around one table, but none of them were really chatting with one another. Instead, all of them were more interested in posting pictures of this \"cheerful\" meeting on their social media sites. Therefore, there is need to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of social media.\n",

              "Social media enables people from different parts of the world to communicate with one another. People used to write letters and send post cards to keep in touch with ones live far away from them in the past. It can take a few days or weeks for those to receive the messages. Nowadays, what people need to do is just typing in front of the computer in their own rooms. And people on the other side will only need a second to receive the message. Distance and time are no longer the problems, which is convenient especially when instant chat is needed. However, when people become more and more addicted to this convenience and fail to communicate with people who are close to them, their face-to-face interpersonal skills are lost. Social media provides people a way of talking and chatting which can never be considered as a way of communication. When ones chat on those media sites, there is no eye connection, no emotion delivery and even the expressions are typed in by using some combinations of punctuations. For more convenience, sentences are shortened to simply three or four words such as lol (which means laugh intensively) and \"asap\" (which means as soon as possible). People indeed go to great length to make their words as shorter as they can. While, once they are communicating with people in their face, expressing themselves appropriately become really a big problem.\n",

It makes people feel extreme close to their admirers' lives and works. Updated news people care about can be easily obtained when you refresh your social media sites on your smart phones and laptops almost every time at any time. However, after one has registered in those social media sites which are not reliable, all the information you have filled in will be a weapon against you in the future. Furthermore, not everyone on the social media sites is honest. The profile picture may not be the person who that user says he or she really is. The reason might just be that he or she just wants to \"decorate\" his or her face. But there is possibility that the person on the other side is deceiving you in order to obtain your information against you. No pledge of authenticity risks people's information and privacy that are shared on social media sites.\n",

Everyone in the world cannot stop using it every day to express their feelings or ideas and a log of other stuff which helps their friends know their lives better. However, it also raised the concerns about whether it brings us more benefits or a human disaster. Although it helps to connect us with our friends wherever we are, it at the same time reduces the chance for us to talk to our friends face to face which may affect our interpersonal skills. Thus, whether there are more advantages or disadvantages becomes a tough question for every human being.\n",

This is especially to people who are overseas. To them, social media is the only resource they can approach to know everything happened in their home country and the way they can use to show their lives to their lovers as well. What's more, these days social media plays an important role in spreading the information. Nowadays, people can just easily put their renting information on their facebook account and wait for the response from others who are from different parts of the world which brings us a huge amount of convenience. It is quite significant especially for those young teenagers since they would rather go to these sites to see the news and know what happened in this world than read the newspaper every day.\n",

They pointed that actually social media reduces the chance for us to talk to people around us face to face. The more we care about facebook, the less time we will have to spend with our friends. Nowadays, it is quite common to see on some party, people would more prefer looking at their phones and reading all the posts on facebook if they feel bored. It makes people worry since if all the teenagers continue using social media frequently, they will decrease the ability to talk to people.

Although it is really useful when we need to use it to let other people know we really live a good life, it wastes us a lot of time as well. Think in another way, if we put those time we spend on wandering on those sites, we may already finish one book or do other more meaningful things. We should keep in mind that there are still ways for us to contact with our family or friends. Everything will be bad if we don't know how to use them wisely no matter whether it is really good or not. As a result, it is important for people to know that we need to be cautious about the time we spend on these social media.\n",

              "Nowadays, as the technology is becoming increasingly advanced, more and more social media sites are showing up in our daily life. You can see people playing Facebook, Twitter through their smart phones or ipad on buses or on trains. Some may say that the appearance for these modern media will reduce the chance for people to communicate face to face. This essay will illustrate the pros and cons of using social media in modern society.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Firstly of all, social media can make it more convenient for people to make friends and contact each other. Years ago when these modern products have not been popular, the way for people to communicate or contact people far way are still restricted in making phone calls, sending emails or writing letters. Some will take long time and some are not efficient enough for people to get their response. However, social media solves these problems well. People can contact their friends on the internet and get their reply very fast. The communication is also not limited in words. People can express themselves through pictures or emotions. People can also get to know their friends' state and mood by looking at their posts on line. Moreover, people can be aware of what is going on in social situation and see the comments online and share their opinions on these websites. These social media makes people's life much more colorful and provide a lot of fun.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "However, social media may do some harm to people's life. It will make people spend more time on chatting on the internet rather than communicate face to face such that the interpersonal skill will be badly affected. Some people spend a lot of time in it and forget their real life. Actually, I have seen some people are very funny and interesting when I am chatting with them online. However, they behave quite boring when I talk to them in real life. Teenagers are developing their interpersonal skills and social skills when they are growing up. If they spend too much time on these social media, it may cause some problems to their mental development. They may feel uncomfortable when they communicate with people face to face. Some may share fewer and fewer time with their family and not knowing how to express themselves. Moreover, some wrong values on the websites will affect teenagers and confuse them. Some may even do something wrong.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "In conclusion, the showing up of social media sites is a double edged sword. It can make our life simpler. People can promote their friendship and relationship through these social media. Whereas, it can also make people forget to communicate to their family and friends in the real life and affect negatively to their interpersonal skills. But overall, the advantages far outweigh its disadvantage. So we need to make best use of these social media and make it a fun way of adding some excitement when life is boring. And try to bypass the shortcomings. Remember to send greetings to our friends and family frequently.\n",

People can know their friends' recently looks and interesting things happens on that people just by checking their facebook or other social media sites. We cannot deny that the social media sites truly make the old friends do not lose the information and the chances to communicate with you even you are in a different country. However, the social media sites truly reduce the communication in face-to-face which truly affects interpersonal skills. There are two advantages and two disadvantages of using the social media in people's daily life.\n",

By typing the words and showing the pictures, people can express their emotions that they are too shy to express. For example, on mother's day, people are shy to say \"I love you\" to their mothers so they can type it on his or her mother's facebook page. Then his or her mother will also know the emotion and feel warm. On the other hand, when the teenager is studying in a foreign country, the internet is the only way that he can communicate with their parents and friends. Therefore, the social media is truly good for people.\n",

They can learn how these people succeed and they can also have the chance to talk with them and know these famous persons' thought by using the social media. On the other hand, with the help of social media, some homeless people or someone who need the money to cure the disease can get the help from the world quickly because once one person know the information, his or her will share it to their \"friends area\", then many people will know it and spread the information to the person who can give help.\n",

Therefore, the social media truly limit the interpersonal skills such that people lose the chance and the ability to practice talking and connect the relation between him and their friends.\n",

We communicate with others using social media, such as twitter, facebook and microblog more and more frequently. There is no need to for people to go out of their home to interact with others, they chat online, share pictures, tell others what they have done or funny stories. It seems that people build a good relationship with others by the social media, but the problems come out. Pepope do not know how to talk with others face to face, especially the strangers. Then, we need to talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using social media in your daily life and society.\n",

              "One advantage is that it is more convenience to contact others by social media. In old days, if one wants to tell some important news to another one, which lives far away, he needs to write letters and it wastes time. The long distance and time-consuming make spreading the messages very difficult at that time. Therefore, people may not contact with the faraway friends and relatives unless there are something important. However, people now can contact with anyone all over the world who can use computer at any time, and there is no time delay of messages.\n",

They may collect information about that person by asking his friends, colleagues or family members. And the information collected may not be intact and true. Unlike today, with the help with social media, people can easily get the information they want just by searching on line, and know about what that person did everyday at what time.\n",

It is weird that people sit around the table but all face to their phones and do not talk with each other. If there is a joke on their facebook page, they may talk to others in this way, \"hi, look, how ridiculous this is\", then they laugh together. No matter it is a party, dinner or just simply get-together, there always are some people bow their head and playing their phones even their family and friends are in front of them.\n",

However, some people worry that social network can affect interpersonal skills as it reduces face-to-face human contact. The advantages and disadvantages of using such social media in the society are elaborated on as follows.\n",

Nowadays, thanks to the help of social media, with just one click, you can contact your family and friends wherever you want. You can share photos, videos and every meaningful experiences of your life. More importantly, it is cheap and easy to use social media.\n",

Young people can widen their relationships, meet new friends and learn wonderful things in many parts of the world. In business area, social media is a good tool to develop and advertise products and services.\n",

              "First and foremost, we should realize that social media world is not trustworthy and real. Everyone can easily make up the personality and characteristics they want. They can become anyone. Though social media do create relationships, relationships and friendships are only firm and real if people have gone through experiences and communication in face-to-face interaction. There is a story of a girl who lives in social media world every night in eight years. In the chat room, she created a close relationship with eight people. She talked with them every night, trust them and share her life with them. Then eventually, she discovered that eight people became one as he was using eight different identities to chat with her all the time.\n",

              "Last but not least, social media does affect human interpersonal skills when people increase the time on social sites and reject chances to expose to social daily life activities as well as interacting with people. Recent research has shown that the more people spend time on social media sites, the less they become ambitious. As a result, if the situation keep go on in this unexpected trend, it will cause a bad effect on the young generation.\n",

It not only is convenient and beneficial in connecting people and developing the business but it also can damage people relationships and interpersonal skills. Social media is only beneficial as long as we know how to use it in a correct and suitable way with the combination of both social media sites and daily life interaction to develop people's potentials to the fullest.\n",

              "In modern digital world, electronic products are widely used in daily lives such as Smart phones, computers and etc. In work places, electronic devices such as computers are also inevitable to use to increase the productivity of the corporation. The convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products is being noticed by people worldwide. Some people started to think if electronic products can be further operated to more advanced utilization and replace human beings for better performances. Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) is one type of examples that has currently been implemented. In this essay, I will discuss that if surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should be used or not to track people. Personally, I agree to a large extent that surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people.\n",

              "Surveillance technology such as RFID can be operated twenty-four hours with the absence of operators to track done every detail about human activities. For instance, in militaries which are of high importance, surveillance technology is essential as it is a way to provide undeniable evidences if anything are fault. In supermarkets where it is difficult to catch stealers, surveillance technology which makes records that can be replayed or detect stealers on the spot are superior to use. The high accuracy in utilizing surveillance technology eliminates the amount of disagreements among people. If people are aware of the existence of surveillance, the chance for them to follow rules and orders is high. It is useful as it reduces the chances of wrong doings that may occur. Therefore, surveillance technology makes our society more ordered.\n",

              "Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what was happened in the past. In late nineteenth century, there was a severe air crash happening at Miami international airport. The air cargo of the Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off. Sooner or later, the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed. All passengers and pilots were died. After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incidence, police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence. Surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future, hence to save more lives. In addition, if surveillance technology is even better developed, it can be used to detect the problem before the real accidence has happened.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "However, the dark side of using surveillance technology is that it results in the invasion of privacy. People under supervision are under high pressure to perform naturally. People are less likely to enjoy life under surveillance. Therefore, surveillance technology provides convenience to the society but makes more inconvenience to individuals. Therefore, surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life. In general, surveillance technology benefits the society and should be applied with the consideration of individuals' life.\n",

In this fast moving society, technology is always improving to catch up the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or other army usage to track people down. Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy, it has also brought us lots of benefits and security. There are two points supporting this argument. Firstly, security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace. Secondly, it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents. Therefore, this technology should be used to track people.\n",

              "Many of this surveillance are being implemented in the government sectors, military areas to enhance their security. It can also be found in schools and workplaces. It is useful to the government and the people in the law sector. They can maintain social control and recognize threats. Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen. In addition, it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed. For example, intruders can be detected if there are any in schools or offices. This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery. In addition, it can also prevent theft. This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist the law enforcers such as the police to collect evidences of crime after it occurred. This can increase the efficiency of solving the crime and thus decreasing the amount of criminal acts or people. With the help of the video surveillance, the chances of people performing crimes can be decreased.\n",

For example, it could be installed in personal lockers to record other's moves and actions. This technology could also be seen as invasion of human's privacy. Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched. This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society. If everyone is being watched unknowingly, it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded.\n",

The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it. The more people using it over us, the more power they will have on us. We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other's permission, this should not be placed or implanted to anyone. We do not want to be sued infringing other's privacy, therefore, before implanting any RFID, we should ask for other's consent.\n",

And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life, products such as RFID tracking system have become real. RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose, it is also used to track people by doing human implants. It is unacceptable for some people in the society, however, I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit.\n",

For example, there are always news on newspaper, report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her. The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly, and with the help of police office , maybe they can find the elderly back, but it will take a long time, and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person. However, if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices, then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently. They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time.\n",

It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that doing the business to trade the children. For example, they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but didn't pay attention to the child, so that this kind of agency may bring the child to mountain area and sell him or her with a good price. Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to. Since this may happen across province, and without any clue about the path that the child may went through. However, if the child has been installed with tracking device, more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back. Not only the details of location will be provided, but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family.\n",

People's lives become from increasingly convenient to almost luxury, thanks to the implementation of increasingly technology available for the Man's life.

Even our applications in our Iphones or other smartphones, our I-pad can easily revealed our locations. Every moves of us are being closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of homes. Now, surveillance technology such as RFID is even invented to track people. I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted.

We revealed our locations, for our friends to catch up with us, however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly. Hackers become increasingly vicious, invading into our computer system, now with radio-frequency tracking device, this may fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons.

Additionally, if appropriately used, this device can contributed to our scientific findings and research.

For using as a surveillance tool, it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics. There are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research. Moreover, the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point.\n",

This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to the society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order. As this information is been well keep by the operators where they encrypt the data and used it in the proper form. This also prevents the chances of normal hackers to get this information that were recorded for proper usages are misused for unlawful usages.\n",

Nowadays, with the rapid development of science and technology, the emerging technologies always contribute to human beings better living conditions. For example, the Internet has abridged the distance among people globally. Although we have to admit some bad effect which is brought up by the new technology, still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded. Back to the surveillance technology, people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life. Compared to this disadvantage, we should think about what the advantages it has make available for human beings. It can provide a safe, convenient, identifiable environment.\n",

In case, they have some accident like heart attack, the track of them will show there is something wrong. The people can get there as soon as possible to save them. For the young people, parents do not need to worry about where my kids will go after the school. By investigating the track by the surveillance technology, they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing. On the other hand, due to the track of people, the police can better know a person's daily schedule. It gives the police a better control of the criminal. All these contributions by using the surveillance technology to track make the environment safer.\n",

If we have these technologies, it will automatically confirm people's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards. Once people have their own identity confirmed, they can even need not to bring any money along with them. To purchase goods, they just need to deduce money from their identity and make a transition of money to the one who is selling the goods.

Then, you may ask, how can the police get the information? I think that the track can be saved in some place which is not open to public.

In the first case, RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends' home, and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior.\n",

Thus, when a man with a 'terrorism tag' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode TNT.

Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures, what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made. Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country.

However, when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people, it is my opinion, that, such technology should rethink its way of existence.\n",

              "In fact, people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet. Social networks such as facebook ,Tiwtter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without being realised. This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage. The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people. Such incident happened in London a few years ago, when the government installed CCTV() on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order. This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others. Instead, when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper, it was heavily cricised by the public. People were claiming the lost of privacy. Government had to uninstall all the devices in the end. From this case, we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way, however, when it touches the privacy of people themselves, it is unacceptable.\n",

              "From the point of humanity, it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings. We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as goods, it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged. However, human beings are not animals or any other products, they have their own thoughts and freedom. They have a full control of their own lives. If so, then why do we need human implants to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like. It is understandable that once people have human implants, they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out. However, this way of curbing the crimes is so violent that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the track of such device. Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality. Humanity can be best seen in the case of pets rearing. Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets. However, in countries like China, where there is no law to force people to chain their pets, pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets. It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive, however, it is the benevolence nature of human beings that we treat pets as \"human beings\", our friends that we do not want to restrict their freedom. This phenomenon is accepted by the public even by those who do not own a pet. This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harms to someone, people still prefers to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom. Even pets are granted with freedom, people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential.\n",

              "In conclusion, I think that surveilence technology should not be allowed to be used to track people. it does not only restrict their freedom in all aspects , but also cause leakage of personal information. This greatly violets the rights of people.\n",

Example of this technology is RFID (radio-frequency identification) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people. However, this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons. I personally stand together with the population who reject the proposal.\n",

It represents a query: is not everyone can view each other's information such as name and age? The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue to personal, violation of freedom and breakdown of safety. One of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip. Criminal could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved. He or she could easily touch on the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers.\n",

However, people tend to express their personal feeling and idea about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally. This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent movement could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tag or implant. Internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of personal if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of designated person.\n",

However, the chip implant can be retrieved out easily and replanted onto other people and so on the tag. Mischief cases could actually cause a chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally. For example, a wanted person can escape out easily from a country and hide in another country with this method.

It basically served to allocate your iphone's position at any single time, For instance, if someone left his phone in a certain place, he can check his phone's location by searching through the internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friends' device. You are able to find the location of your lost iphone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other.\n",

              "Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to the place that someone has never being there before. For example, one person wants to visit his friends place in a new city. His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology. Then, the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking device to find the place even he has never gone to there before. The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well. For instance, when people getting old, they begin to loss their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other place. If the old people always bring an auto-tracking device, it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people.\n",

              "Although the auto-tracking device is quite powerful, it still has to be used in volunteering bases. Without the agreement, people should not able to use this technology to track others. For example, if the tracking technology is able to track everyone even strangers, this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online. These kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto track you and you are not able to run out of them. Therefore, we must agree with the statement before the technology is able to track us. At the same time, our location should be protected from seen by the strangers. All the conditions must be agreed by the person that agrees auto-tracking device to track him like, the time of tracking and who can view your location.\n",

By following the trend of improvement in technology, people can now easily tracked by using RFID (radio-frequency identification) by simply implant a RFID tags on human body. With this advantage, it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lost contact or in an urgent and also for police to investigate crimes.\n",

There are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that acquired by kidnappers. In that case, they would have no choice but to seek for the power of loyal police. The detective will start investigate the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities. Reality kills people in mind. There is only 10% of all the time of successfully pinpointed the kidnappers den and arrested all of them before they starts to harm the poor victim. In that sense, without a proper way to track human being, it is way too difficult to save those innocent life. Also, not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down, but also jailbreakers. Few years ago, there was a jailbreaker named Mat Selamat, one of the members of the terrorists of Osama, successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore. That was a rare case since Singapore is actually an absolutely safe country. According to news, the police force had mobilized thousand of cops, each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after few months, none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and rearrested him. People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode.

In this mean time, surveillance technology is founded which mean that we are able to track people at every time in everywhere.

However, some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners' body. Their opinions are founded on the basic human rights. Prisoners' privacy is endangered due to the RFID. After they release from the prison, the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government.

This technology leads to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy. Children are given birth by their parents; parents are responsible to take good care of them.

Children can easily be track based on the location of cell phone by parents. Compared to the human implant, tags on the products is better and more suitable. Under the products tags, children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant.

To know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiency. For example, UPS can track the process of each delivery. With the information about the location of the cargo, it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company. RFID is one of the advanced technology for tracking. Due to the small size of the equipment and the energy-saving feature, it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics. However, it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watch or clothes, it did provide convenience in a certain situation.\n",

One of the basic rights of human is the right for privacy. In any period of time, as long as we do not offense others, we should enjoy the right of privacy. However, the idea of using RFID to track people violates our need for privacy. Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time, it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities. For example, a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket. As the RFID is embedded within the product, people who have the access to the information definitely can track him. However, the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag, so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address, working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information. If this piece of information is misused, chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even cause danger to the life of the consumer. Moreover, if the product is what one needs to use every day like clothes or shoes, then the location of one will be revealed every seconds. This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you. It is not only scary but also illegal. Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose, it is still not appropriate. We can think about this scenario: the location of us going on daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second. Does this sound reasonable to you?\n",

A report shows that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world. This is because of two reasons, one is the strict law in Singapore, and the other is the dense surveillances everywhere. During the year 2003, surveillance strategies helped Singapore beat the SARS and successfully prevented the spreading of the epidemic situation. At that time, Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillances in every patient's home to look after their actions. Much media has reported the effective measures of installing the surveillances in Singapore. Without the using of the surveillance, the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly, and the loss caused by SARS might be many times than that in 2003 in Singapore. The benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the fighting of SARS, and this is a success example of the surveillance.\n",

Every words people say can be heard by the government and because of that, government know well about everyone's mind and want to wash everyone's mind and control normal people totally. It is a country without any freedom and democracy in the novel. In the reality, people are afraid of being tracking everywhere, not because of meaning to crime, but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone's heart. When a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife, none of the couple want it to be heard by the people behind the monitors. Normal people's privacy needs government seriously considered about.\n",

              "People needs a safe environment to live in, and also needs a private environment to stay independent. The surveillance is a useful method to keep society's safe, but also kills the privacy of people in some degree. The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life, and then the surveillance is no more needed. At that time, even if there is no surveillance above people's heads, there are surveillances in everyone's heart and criminals are more difficult to hide.\n",

              "Nowadays, humans live in a modern society. Around people, there are full of high technology like CCTVs, automatically sorting system for goods and different information systems. In order to bring more benefit and ensure people's safety, surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in UPs and DHL, these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods. It is convenient for customs to track and confirm where and how their goods are now. However, besides tracking goods for people, people begin to use this technology to track people. I do not agree this kind of behavior, because humans are different from goods, cannot treat humans as goods.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "There is no a doubt, tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age. No matter where people go, taking bus or MRT, people are under the CCTVs, it is very important and useful to track and find people. Actually, tracking system has provided people safety indemnification.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "However, tracking people are difficult and different from goods. For instance, a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore, and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another. Goods are dead, but humans are alive. If one company really uses this technology to track their employees, employees will dislike and claim that their humans' right and privacy have been violated. In another a word, people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like goods, because modern people need more homage not money. So, when employees begin to conflict with this tracking system, they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards. Finally, the company tracking system has no meaning at all, therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In addition, tracking people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way. How to explain this problem, it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking system. For example, people go somewhere, no matter taking bus, MRT or driving, they are under the CCTVs. If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes, by hacker technology, they can use government tracking system to do their own business. In other words, government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety, now it has been divulged human information. It is very dangerous for society, because people do not know who are tracking them, it must bring citizens trepidation.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In conclusion, what I have mentioned above, we have to agree, tracking system has many benefits in different parts in humans life especially in this modern world. But tracking people is very terrible choice, it sounds like people invented a 'prison' to jail themselves, people need homage and freedom. Also tracking people is very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men in a not good purpose. So Surveillance technology should not be used to track people.\n",

In the transportation, almost all of the people have transport cards for daily transport. Since we do not to bring cash to pay for the transportation fee, enormous time has been saved for everybody. For the society, there will be a more efficient transportation system. For the logistics, if all the products are attached to the tags, it is much easier to count and record all the products. This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product lost because of the tracking. Since the inventory management is very important for some kind of companies, this technology is playing a very significant role. The super markets are also using this technology to tag their product, which can record the conditions of all of the products in time and prevent of stealing. When checking out, the price tag will be scanned to get the total payment very quickly. This will save the customers time and also improve the profit of the market.\n",

In some kindergartens, the RFID is used to tab the children to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts. On the condition that the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self-conscious, this system can prevent them from lost.\n",

The first type is just say the ID card which is carried externally by the person. By using this card, our identities can be confirmed and the information in a certain institution can be kept. However, this will raise a privacy protection issue. How can it be guaranteed that our information will not be abused? Maybe this part can be resolved by using another technology. For example, the ID card can be implanted into a switch which can be controlled by the owner. When not using it, just switch off the card, then it will be just a useless paper. Another human identification is Implanting RFID chips into human body. For this part, not only the privacy problem is concerned, but the human health. Does the implanting chip definitely safe and feasible? Will it affect the normal functionality of the other organs? All of these problems are waiting to be resolved.\n",

In crime investigation, the truth of evidence is necessary, which can only be made by photos, videos or small tracks. In supermarket monitor is needed because we have to track thieves. In front of ATM we need monitor to avoid intentional crime. We need CCTV in every public corner to track suspicious. Only in this way can we get evidence of bad movement to protect others. The objective truth in CCTV is helpful and efficient in crime investigation, better than asking witness again and again to identify who is the liar.\n",

              "Secondly, surveillance technology can decrease the illegal actions effectively. Imagine there are no CCTV in public. People will act as if there is no supervision. No evidence is recorded. Cheating can be very popular in examination and stealing will seldom incur punishment. In a Chinese kindergarten, Children were always abused by a teacher but no one else knows that. Children told their parents. Some parents were too busy to take care of children while other parents did not believe what children said. The headmaster did not know how the teacher really is and she did not fire her even when some children were afraid of entering the teacher's class. After so many children were abused, people came to know the truth. Shadow was made on children's heart and there is nothing we can do to make up for it. Now people suggest that every classroom in every kindergarten should have a monitor, otherwise the teachers' action cannot be supervised. If there had been a monitor in the classroom, maybe parents and headmaster could realize earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could get protection earlier.\n",

In a car accident related to an official's relative, the record was modified with a new record. The person in the record had been changed with another one before it was released to the public. The modification was so obvious that people can easily recognize. In China, things like that will happen because the legal system is not sound enough. Power is concentrated in a few people. The problem of abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power. Avoiding corruption and separating power is more important than forbidding surveillance technology.\n",

There is a truth that we cannot deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes machine is more honest than people. We have to admit that how to prevent the abuse and how to use it reasonably depend on a sound legal system, and it means surveillance has its own restriction.\n",

By law, citizens have the rights to keep their privacy unknow to public, whereas the privacy would be exposed if such surveillance technology is applied widely. Many pupils in China have been complaining about their phones, because with the phones at hands, their lives are all transparent to their parents. Such technology would put people into the same circumstance as those pupils where the government plays the role of parents trying to find out whatever people are doing every second.

Some people may claim that it is good for security as when every one is under tracking, those poteintial criminals also are. By logic it seems perfectly right. However, whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the authority. When the authority treats liberty as a crime, the society becomes terrible. It has been doubted that whether a society that is under close surveillance will be a good one to live in. Many science fictions have made good efforts in describing a future of human in which every body in society is put under close surveilliance of the governments. Surprisingly, none of these are describing the future as a bright one. In history, there were times when the government wants to secure its gorvernance so badly that its police sniffed around people like dogs, such as the Nazi Germany, the Soveit Union. People nowadays would agree that it is terrible to live in those societies. Then why would they agree to put themselves into those societies?\n",

Although we are not implanted chips we are exposed under CCTV. It is a common questioned asked by lots of people that as the technology develops and we benefit from it, we are losing our privacy.

When I work, it seems I am holding my heart working since if I am doing something wrong or relax in working time. Next minute, I may have a tea with my manager. Such a nightmare owes to abuse of Surveillance technology. Although we all understand the installing of CCTV is used for protect us from criminal, nowadays, it seems to be abused too much. According to article Lawful Interception, in US, every telecommunication companies have contract with FBI, requiring them to keep the phone call record easily searchable and accessible for FBI. Moreover, as showed in many Hollywood movies, Google mail is also accessible for FBI. There are so many people in FBI, although it is under strict rule, and we cannot think ideally there will not be any one abuse its power and access those resources for private purpose and lease them out. Leasing of private information, even though it only happened one time, but one is too many for an individual. Moreover, the money spend on telephone call record is $1.8 million per year.\n",

              "As the fast growing of electrical technology, people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our life to make full use of it. Many advantages have been shown in the areas like politics. Because of the surveillance technology, more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be used. However, disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoying. That is to say, there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technology. From the view of my point, I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security.\n",

              "Firstly, privacy will not be protected if everything is under monitoring. We cannot imagine our every move is under track and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through the monitor. That sounds like we are naked in front of the public, there is no secret and even privacy for us. Perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety, but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety. Therefore, the surveillance technology cannot be casually used.\n",

              "Secondly, it may be used by lawbreakers. There is no denying that every coin has two sides. The technology also applies. On one side, we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crimes. On the other side, the technology can also be probably used by the lawbreader to commit crimes. And once this happens, privacy does not exist any more and people's life is under great threaten. Therefore, this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that has been appeared.\n",

              "Thirdly, it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily life. Say, a person whose salary is 2000 dollars per month. And he spends 1000 dollars to install the surveillance system in his house. Then if his house got stolen, the perhaps he can use the surveillance to get his money back. However, if nothing happened inside his house, then the surveillance becomes useless, and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being supervised.

These fields are special because of the job category, and the need to be open to the public, so the disadvantages will not be shown.

These statistical analyses will give governments more accurate information when drafting policies. An example of making an good informed decision is the story of the planning and constructing of a walking path, where the government has a lack of information and decides that the people needs a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a randomly location. However, they could have built the walking path on a dirt path that has been walked out by the people themselves.

              "With the development of technology, we have more advanced method to track people in today's society. Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) is frequently used by the police to track people who are considered suspicious. However, the using of surveillance technology is usually done secretly, and a debate has been aroused today that whether surveillance technology should be abandoned. Some socialists argue that installing surveillance device on people offends human rights and should be totally abandoned. However, people who are taking security job assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively. In my point of view, surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutions.\n",

Although that method may invade certain people's right and privacy, but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society. If the surveillance technology is abandoned, it makes the police very difficult to track the suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to the society. For example, without surveillance technology, the murders can escape much more easily since no one knows their position. Without surveillance technology, the suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police cannot arrive in time to help out. On the other hand, the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police. If that technology is abandoned, it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or stole things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law. Therefore, the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary.\n",

With the popularization of surveillance technology, a more concise and more complete regulations of using that is highly needed. For example, making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided, which is also a effective way to protect human right. Only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help tracking the murders or people suspected. With proper use of surveillance technology, surveillance technology can be a good tool for the police, and also benefit all the society.\n",

              "In the modern society, public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon. In the United States, after the horrible attack on 11 September, the US congress passed the Patriot Act, which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance, to counter against the terrorists. However, although these bureaucratic actions prevent another similar attack from happening again, the act is widely criticized for its violation over individual privacy. With the development of surveillance technology such as RFID, spy on the population can be much easier, which will create even worse scenery for the citizens. In this paper, the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "First, the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased. Typically, the RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip. The regular distance of data exchange can be several meters. Once such chip is loaded with personal information and implants in individuals, all the information about his or her life can be recorded. Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in place like airport and check point. However, the fact is that such technology will create check points everywhere. Furthermore, such tracking on individuals is done without permission of the subject person. That is to say, people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness. In such situation, individuals will lose their basic privacy.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "Second, when technology like RFID is widely used, there will be a trend to misuse such technology. An important feature of RFID is the minimal security. Since it is read-only, the card cannot protect itself. Moreover, almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology. Then, if a business man wants to defeat his competitor, he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets. Hence, once RFID is widely used, people are very likely to spy on each other, which will destroy trust, respect and many moral values.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "Third, to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authority. The government is supposed to serve the people. However, once the government gathers too much power, the democracy may be turned into totalitarianism, and such surveillance technology provides the measures. Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals is the first step. When government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens, it can gradually apply control over them. Consequently, the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority, which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "All in all, surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority. Privacy must be respected, and power over other should be controlled. Without such surveillance technology, we can still live a better future.\n",

              "With the development of the science and technology, people nowadays are living under various surveillances, for example, CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in public area. Recently, a new coming surveillance technology called radio-frequency identification which is RFID for short has caused heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people. Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration. However, As far as I am concerned, using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration, rescue and police events.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "During scientific exploration, especially the geographical ones, the tracking is very important. This tracking will help scientists to better get their result and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back. In addition, people who research in biodiversity will also need to be tracked. When these scholars are on the field journey, they also have to relate their observation with their route information; this is when RFID is of great significance. In addition, field journeys are sometimes very dangerous. Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas. Their safety may face huge challenge. For this kind of situation, RFID will help a lot.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Actually, not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling, RFID can defend human beings from harm. Firstly, knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger. Furthermore, by telling the geographical position of the people, RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims. During the rescue, every second is valuable!\n",

              "RFID is also functional in police events. By getting the track of the suspensors, police officers can decide who the criminal exactly is sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event. Furthermore, knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process. Policeman can just go to the certain place and chase the criminal. Besides, tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals' privacy. Nevertheless, the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues. Firstly, for scientific exploration, rescue and police events, the privacy factors are far less important than the individual or social safety and scientific results. In addition, for observation journeys and traveling, we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit.\n",

By using this technology reasonably, it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developing path.\n",

              "With the development of science and technology, surveillance technology is playing its role in people's lifes. It monitors anybody's movement or activity, and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law, etc. When surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our life, some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe. Personally, I think surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people, for the benefit it brings to me cannot match the concerns it causes.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "It has been quite a long time since someone raises the importance of the right of privacy. Without doubt, surveillance technology is going against the right since it leaks out people's information without getting their permission. When the technology is not so well developed, it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information. While as it becomes highly developed, it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where did you go and what did you do. It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie, and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under others observation, just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world, broadcast to billions of people.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "When I have such feelings, I will feel that I am not belongs to human beings as everyone else any longer, instead, I am like a pet or a tool to be made fun of by others. It is more like a prisoner's life, because we are under other people's control and we can do nothing to change our situation.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "On the other hand, when we allow surveillance technology being used to track people, it increases the successful rate of people taking bad actions. For example, thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed of everyone's location. That will also cause more social concerns.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "However developed our society is , Technology should always serve us as a tool instead of constraining us like ropes. Every technology is born with its advantages and its shortcomings just like nuclear power or weapons. If we cannot choose the proper way to use it, we taste the bad consequences of it. As to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our life quality but also violating our right of privacy, I think we should not use it to track people. All of us hope to live in a freer, more relaxed and safer world.\n",

Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually. The rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted if population ages; high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive ageing people. However, it is considered as an achievement as there is low competency in workforce. Rising life expectancies is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement.\n",

This results in an unbalanced ratio between young people and older people. This is a challenge as it reduces the productivity of countries, and hence affecting the productivity of the world. Globally, manpower is lacking. Although current world is a digital world which more machines are used to replace manpower, manpower is required to operating these machines so that they can better functioned. In countries like Singapore, manpower is the only natural resources available which Singapore can invest on as she does not have enough lands to build farms and factories. In addition, Singapore focuses more on developing its tertiary industry which are mainly consisting of services. People are needed. More importantly, Singapore wants to be a knowledge based country, more highly educated people are required. Ageing results in less manpower and less highly educated people are available in proportion.\n",

In general trend, elderly people are easy to be ill as compared to young capable adults. More healthcares are needed for elderly people than young adults. In most countries healthcare are provided freely from government. As a result, government need more taxed from companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare to elderly people. Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65. This is an age which most people is retired and has no sources of incomes. Their purchasing power is low. In an aged population, low spending affects the economic growth. Companies are in trouble if they cannot earn sufficient money to sustain their business and they also need to pay high taxes to the government.

Healthcare is better than in the past. They can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fares to maintain their health to a better condition.\n",

              "With the ageing population, many countries are facing the same challenge as to build safety houses, facilities to cater to the old aged. After a certain age, they will have to retire. The challenge of many ageing countries will rise when no new generation could take over their place in that particular trade. First, I will discuss on the challenge of having an ageing population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall. Secondly, I will discuss the ageing population as an achievement where they implement healthy lifestyles and good eating habits.\n",

              "When people start to age, many diseases will surface up un-noticing. Therefore, for the welfare of the ageing population, more old age hospitals will have to be built. Land space will be limited when more hospice are build to take care of the elderly people. With illnesses surfacing and the increase in ageing population, increasing amount of nurses and doctors will have to be present. However, not many young people are passionate about helping the society or even helping the elderly. Hence, the country will face a big challenge as to take care of the elderly. In addition, retirement is a must in some countries. This could cause a drastic fall in their economy as if the younger generation could not take over their work, no one will continue. It is thus a big challenge to the country as there is no one boosting their economy.\n",

              "The ageing population could be an achievement as this indicates measures are being implemented to have a healthy lifestyle by the people. The more old people the country has, the more experience they will be as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and making them not make the same mistakes as them. This will help the country to move forward rapidly. The more exercise or any other forms of work out can prolong the lifespan of people. It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death, thus living longer. Food can be a big part of our lives. Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan. An example will be in Korea. It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition, the people will have a good skin complexion. True enough, their population is ageing but people there can live very long due to the food they are consuming. Thus, food can play an important role to the population.\n",

              "Ageing population is a prolonged and persistent societal problem that is being frowned upon in most of the developed countries. As the standard of living increases, the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies, which have advanced over the decades, among the general public has become increasingly available. People of the nations are likely to be well-taken care of, partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by the respective government. In the following, I will take Singapore as the case study as a reference to my discussion.\n",

              "Rising life expectancies can be a pro to family affairs. There is a Chinese saying that goes, \"Jia you yi lao, ru you yi bao\". This means, having an elderly at home is equivalent to having a gold at home. Where every home houses an elderly, the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and morale values. Where filial piety and respect for the elder are highly emphasized in Chinese traditions, the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and so as for their parents. With good communication and interaction, an elderly can guide the young with valuable lessons in life. An individual is an unit of the society, every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the society and nation's growth.\n",

A long-lived and healthy individual is sometimes being related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one received. In another words, it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective, well-managed by the Government. This gives credits to the Government's medical and healthcare schemes. Thus, rising life expectancy can be seen as an achievement of the Government's well-planned or managed schemes. However, this shall not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates of a nation's provision of quality healthcare benefits and livings for the senior citizens.\n",

In order to cope with the ageing population that pulls down or hinders the economic development, more physically capable and young workforces are required in the society. If failed to fulfil this requirement, this will lead to more financial strains such as increased tax imposed on the societal or company working groups. This can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of working groups towards the government, decreasing birth rates where people could not afford the children expenses of their upbringings and educational fees, that adds on more burdens and worries for the government.\n",

              "Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement. We should separate it into two aspects. The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge. The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement. They are not contradicting with each other. In my opinion, the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction, which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation. On the other hand, the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction, which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past. So, in the following, I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies.\n",

              "For the first part, rising life expectancies is a challenge. We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising. The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher. For these older people, the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them. Sometimes, older need more man power and resources than normal young people. However, these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society. We have to say that the older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources. So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age. Not only has the family member of the old people, but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation. This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "For the second part, rising life expectancies is also an achievement. The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past. In the ancient time, due to the less development of science and technology, people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy. Hence people died of various diseases. On the other hand, there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people's daily life. People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth. These small things makes the quality of people's life less enjoyable than today. Bad mood cannot give them a longer time of life. Due to all these reasons, people died quite early, which results in a low life expectancy. So, the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living. In that sense, rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement.\n",

              "From these points, we ourselves should be glad that we can live longer and enjoy a better living environment. Besides, we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulder, the older people. We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old. In such a situation, the society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way. We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement.\n",

Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem. However, there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement.\n",

              "Rising life expectancy is a challenge in a sense that it is highly relied on development of medication. There are a series of diseases that hinders longevity. Cancers, as a major group of killing diseases, is often beyond current medication to get fully healed. Once cancers are too late to discovered, one is deemed to death at a later stage. Other diseases such as mental disorder and heart trouble are also top killers, the current medication does have methods to treat the patient, but risks still come along. Apart from diseases themselves, deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer. Patients in many developing and less developed countries, especially African countries, are suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their life, albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people. To raise life expectancy, one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medication system. Government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete medication system.\n",

Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines are involved, people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandises in factories. Machines have replaced a bunch of coolies and heavy labor. Cars and trucks diminish the redundancy of long time shipment. As a result, people have more time to enjoy advantage of modern life. One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams for his lifetime. One can also easily see his deeply loved one through internet from miles away. More importantly, they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through Internet, to make more interested people get involve and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful. The development of technology brings people joy, making things easier and this may be one of the achievements.\n",

But data that shows the rising of life expectancies is indeed an achievement that reveals the improvement of modern life. As for the future, who knows? We are on the right track.

The condition of the living environment is also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places. The improvement in technology also eases people's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works. Due to the three major factors stated above, people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments, are able to cure their diseases considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labourous work. The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation.\n",

As the aging population grows, the young and more energetic people are subject to support more people of old age. This creates a huge social burden to them and might cause some of them leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable. This would result in the lose of manpower in a country. Another aspect would be that as the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves, they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves. This would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum. Government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it. Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business. This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country.\n",

On the other hand, people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such as newer I-Pad model. In fact, these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past. However, ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it. Ageing population leads to a working force composed of larger percentage of elders who are lower productivity and thus unable to meet the expectancy.\n",

In addition, the younger generation eager to start their own family at another place rather than staying together with family. This phenomenon increases the demand of land property and subsequently affects their price and size together. Increasing size of population also leads to the problem in food supply. The production of food is showing a lower growth rate compare to population's growth rate which will end up with insufficient food in the future.\n",

              "People's average age has become longer compared to the past. From one perspective, it shows that the medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceases. From another perspective, there are more and more elder people but less younger ones, the increase in population age has weaken the labor force and so on. In my opinion, the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement.\n",

              "Firstly, the population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology. Compare the technology today and the past, we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable, the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases. The fast development of medicine and technological product makes people's life much healthier compare to the past. Moreover, the increased technologies help people to overcome different natural disasters. People are able to predicate some disasters like the earth quake and do the prevention beforehand.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Although the increase in population ages shows that people have increased knowledge and technologies, it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement. The technology is always improving and it never stops, and the lifespan of people are getting longer as well. Thus, we should not compare now with the past but we need to worried about the future problems that caused by this situation.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "The first challenge is the decreasing number of new born. As the population ageing are growing, as people getting old, they need to be cared by others and are not able to contribute as the same as they were young. If the number of old people is too much and there is lesser number of younger people, it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less, the productivity and technology improvements will be less. At the same time more people are needed to take care of the old ones, which gives the younger generation extra works. The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources. As we know that population of human continues in growth year by year, we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life, for example, the oil, people's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil. However, these natural resources are not renewable. We do not consider much for our offspring. Ever imagine one day that no natural resources are left what will be the life of our next generation. The increase in population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think out some idea like to prevent using too much natural resources.\n",

We have to consider more about our future generation, aware of the problem that over aging brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges.\n",

An improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises. Studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years, in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even more. In spite of that, people should aware that the power of science is not almighty, life will still go to their last page without revelation. Since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor, people relies the skills of treatment of doctors and hence, they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health.\n",

In the past, when people injured or fall into sickness, there is no guarantee that the people will get well treatment and fully recovered, therefore people can easily die by infected of a small disease. With the grand medical skill we are having nowadays, human lived longer and hence, a great increasing in population. It would be great if life expectancies keep rising up day by day, but in reality, it does not seem to be so easy. Firstly, although the treatment is reliable, people would still need to have the awareness of their own health condition. There are millions of doctor all over the world, but there are billions of patients as well. Nowadays, the pressure from the head of a company towards those employee caused that people has to be fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that, people starts to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplement. Pressure can really cause sickness just like virus and germs and it is more like a chronic disease. It is like a key that open up the gate of human body defend system and provide a cleared path for other disease to attack in. Therefore, when the era is improving itself, the disease does it too. It is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and keeping the life span to grow as people do sick every moment.\n",

In the era of Warring State, warriors lose their arms or legs or even all of them. The rest of their life has to be relied on their family and the financial support from the others. Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them had chosen to suicide without giving troubles to the others. Nowadays, things have changed. Disabled people walks with artificial legs, man can getting pregnant, even the sexual of a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery. It is really a great achievement in enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history.\n",

Otherwise, there are more and more people staying at the street and destroy the good view of Garden City. In addition, it is also a challenge for government, family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial. With the moral of filial, most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life. It is to prevent from sending them to old folk's house and do not visit them at all.

              "In 1712, Watt renovated the steam machine which increases the efficiency of the fuel. This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution. As the technology develops faster and faster during 301 years, people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily life. This significantly raised people's average life expectancy. However, as the life expectancy of people rises, population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon. Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65. Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually. As the rise of life expectancies can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development, it can be seen an achievement of human being. However, as the energy and resources use up, more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem, so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challenge.\n",

              "As we are human who are different from other animals, we have some basic rights like right to privacy, right to live, right to have a family and so on. Among these basic rights, the most important one is the right to live. During the less developed times, due to disasters like droughts ,floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths, people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time. However, as the technology develops, it increased people's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies. As we can use the resources with maximum efficiency, we can enjoy more and more life material than any time of human society. Even when the disaster comes, we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time than before. For example, the tsunami in Tohoku of Japan in 2011 is \"the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II\" as CNN commented. (CNN, 2011) However, only one year has passed, most of the survivors have come back to their normal life although with a sad memory. This is not imaginable during less developed times. With the strong back support of technology, the rises of life expectancies can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society.\n",

              "However, along with the increase of life expectancies, ageing problems becomes more and more severe. Two of the most important causes of ageing problem is the increasing longevity and declining fertility. The increasing longevity is due to fast development of the society so as the living pressure. The increasing pressure will lead to the declining fertility. As people who are incapable of production become more and more, our society follows a downward trend. Moreover, as we use up more and more resources, what we have left may not enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resource to do research of developing new technology. Therefore, the increase of life expectancies is also a great challenge.\n",

Nowadays, population aging is becoming a problem especially in the developed countries. Now in Singapore, we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown. Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies, it is challenging also can get some achievement.\n",

              "In the first place, rising life expectancies could cause resources challenge. In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, if people still increase the humans' life, but for these small developed regions, the resources are very limited especially land. Because the land is limited, so the average land for one person is very small already. Some years, there is a report on Hong Kong citizens living situation, in a small room there are eight people, they cannot do anything in the room, only can sleep and the air in the room is very bad. So rising life expectancies will make the world population larger, more people shall the limited resources. In economic, we can use GDP to explain the challenge, if GDP is low, it shows that most of people are living in a hard life, life quality is bad, then it will cause the terrible society problem, at last, it will happen the society disturbance. The reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation.\n",

People's life quality has been better now, in order to continue improving, people have begun to consider how to raise their life. Because the life and health are most significant, people have their own reasons to hope living longer. On medicine, people have done a lot of researches on life science. Also people begin to realize the importance of the environment, how to protect people from the harmful air. So according to the humanism, people should make contribution to rising the humans life, because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older, so respecting life should be considered carefully.\n",

However, based on the humanism, humans are different from the animals, people should respect every life. In my opinion, I think we should study balance it well, one side we should continue to make efforts to raise the humans life, one side, we should consider using asking some sick old men whether if they want to take euthanasia. To summary, we respect every life, also help people to live longer.\n",

As our society develops, the people have a much higher living standard, which will reduce the chance of getting disease. Besides, as the development of the technology, the medical therapy also has a tremendous progress. Many diseases which are incurable in the past can be cured now. Therefore, the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive. Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of died people annually. On the other hand, the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing, whose figure is the lowest record comparing to previous figure. Maybe, it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive, the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career. They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children. Maybe that's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate.\n",

              "The fact is that the current average life span is over 65 and the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually. This survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people's living standard has been improved. It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grown. Yet, do not be confused by this superficial amount and achievement. The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky.\n",

The most important part is health care and old-age pension. As elderly people, they need more money for health care than the younger. Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure.\n",

They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures. Therefore, some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people.\n",

Nonetheless, the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered. More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government. More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements. Definitely, we should perform these demanded duties very responsibly and carefully. Whereas, for the sustainable development of the country and the earth, some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon.\n",

Humankind is not an exception. People with rising life expectancies can ensure large population and large species of human being. It is more secure for us because in potential sense we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out. Rising life expectancies is also an evidence of progress of modern medical technology. For ancient people it is miraculous to achieve 70 years old, but now it is general. Rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work force because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person. Longer working period means the old person who is more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over. Thus it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for long time rather than training fresh men.\n",

              "We talk about the first possibility. If there are less young people and more old people, as in both Singapore and China, when elderly retire, there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions. Thus there will be a lacking in labor force, which will lead a decreasing speed of development of the country. Many factories will be deserted and many companies will go bankruptcy, and thus people's life condition will definitely get worse. The past 30-year rapid development of China is connected with the large population, but due to the \"only child\" policy, we have no benefits from large population in the future. With low birth rate, Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country.\n",

Expansion of population cannot continue like that because the resources are limited, and we will end with dying out after using up all resources.\n",

Ageing problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies. With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and more difficult to recover. Without advanced health care system, aged people have higher rate of death. In fact, this was the major limitation of people's average life span in the past. With advanced medical technology, not only many diseases can be cured, but also people know how to keep themselves healthy.\n",

Health caring by far has been expensive to carry out. If the environment is too dangerous to live in, there would be not sufficient medical resources for usage. Such environmental hazards come from various aspects. A major source of the hazards is the pollution. A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habbitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents, among which aged people and children will be harmed most.

If a society has the most advanced medical science and the best environment, but do not grant the access to them to its senior citizens, it just does not help. And if people in society do not want to care for their elderly, nothing will be done for them.

When the percentage of old people grows larger in the population, the labor is considered to become less and each labor need to pay more on the welfare of the old people.\n",

              "If anyone has ever read any fiction or storied written before the 18th century, it is very hard to find any character in those stories lived longer than 80 years old. They may die for hunger, die from illness or just went to bed as usual but never waked again. In China, there is a famous saying that there are things should be celebrated, one is red and one is white. Here, red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away. The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past, it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old, you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away, so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer. It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people felt in the past. Now, technology and science develops at an unbelievably fast pace. There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past vanished in the world. Even though people with cancer, which is still hard to cure, now have more chance to survive and have a longer time to live. Besides illness, the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality. In the same time, it also frees a great amount of labor. Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxury one. It is a break-through of technology and science, and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom.\n",

Before people find another planet to live, the earth is the only habitat for us, and hence the limit of its capacity to support livings, it is the limit of the quantity of people that can live. People's lifetime rising means that the time of the cycle of generation rises. Furthermore, thanks to the development of technology, that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population aging and increasing. To our disappointment, now the technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings by using limited resources. Moreover, the global population aging means that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing. Before robots can fully replace labor, the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use. It is such a challenge that human being cannot avoid and must solve. The only way is to develop technology but the chance to develop is based on people's wisdom and creativity, which is decreasing due to population aging.\n",

              "As with the world is becoming more and more advanced, people are leading a more and more comfortable life. Moreover, the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy. However, while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy, we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing. There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which have gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the source allocation. Therefore, the rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "On one side, we cannot deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancies. The reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution, and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned. Since that we get richer, we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life. Therefore, because of the great efforts we have made, we have been living a better life. And that is what we are striving for. So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves.\n",

Since that we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality, we are leading a longer life. This seems to be a gratifying progress at the first sight. However, during the process of making development to our life, we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down. This also works and we have also seen the effect. Then there comes a problem. Because that the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced, the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased. So the population is getting more and more aged. But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth. That is to say, the population aging has aggravated the burden of the society. Then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face.\n",

It has shown that we are leading a better life but we are forced to face the problem of solving population aging. However, the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges. The significance of our existence is to leading a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world. There is no absolute perfect way, so we have done a good job on the road. Therefore, we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried.\n",

This is the result of better quality of life; which is basically sufficient food and clean water, better sanitations and advanced health-care. With sufficient food, children will develop properly into adults. Better sanitations will result in fewer deaths by infection and significantly reduce the spread of diseases and viruses. Advance healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging the individual's existence on earth. Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics, the cure of poliomyelitis, and better and cleaner surgical procedures. All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies, and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement.\n",

It is highly plausible that the results for increase are the same as the developed countries. If that is true, it means that human rights and living standards are increasing in developing countries, albeit slowly. Fewer famines, better sanitations and more access to healthcare in developing countries will be this century's greatest achievement as a global society.\n",

They will end up putting a burden on the society that they have been contributing their whole working career. With falling birth rates, there will be fewer working adults in society to distribute the workload. In addition, an aging population will require more healthcare and treatment because one's constitution weakens as one ages. The challenge is how many lives can the society and community afford to sustain; and it will only become increasingly difficult to handle.\n",

Large quantities of energy are needed for the pesticides, and to harvest and transport the food produces around the globe. If the current quality of life has to be sustained or increase in order to keep increasing the life expectancies, it will be continue to have a huge impact on the environment.

              "At the present time, people are more concerned about their health. There are better health care systems to let people check their physical condition regularly, and more and more people choose organic food and eat balanced diet to make them healthier. As a result, the current average life span is over 65 worldwide now. By projections of the United Nations, it is shown that population aged more than 60 is increasing at 2% to 3% in the developed and developing countries respectively. The rising life expectancy is a big achievement of human beings. However, as there are only limited space and resource on earth, rising life expectancy is also a challenge for all the people worldwide.\n",

              "Rising life expectancy is a technology achievement. Back to the ancient days, when human beings firstly appeared on the earth, the average life expectancy is only less than 20. The reasons are mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions, the lack of food, the lack of hygiene knowledge, and also very importantly, the lack of medicine. With the development of society, of the past thousands of years, the technology is progressing and the concern for health is arising, so that higher life expectancies are achieved. With more advanced technology in medicine area, more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided. Since people get higher education today, increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered. Such situation is a major progress from the ancient time and also a big achievement by all human beings.\n",

              "However, since the space and resource on earth is very limited, higher life expectancy means more people will live on the earth at the same time and more fierce competition for food and space is unavoidable. Since there are more people on the earth, more space is needed for people to live in, so that some farming land might be turned into buildings to accommodate more people. However, the need for food is also increasing, so that the competition might become even more frightening. What's worse, since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have, violence might take place more frequently. Many violence happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resource. With more people living on the earth, pollution might become even serious, and as a result of pollution, the supply of food and water will decrease, so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve.\n",

              "With the development of the modern society, people lives longer. Statistics shows that worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009. In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland, the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80. Normally, people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement, and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countries. However, as the population is ageing, the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realized. In a nut shell, rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challenge.\n",

Without life, we have nothing. In the long history of the evolution, we are always struggling for life against staving and illness. In last two centuries, we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society. We are modernized and we have gained improved living standard and medical care. We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness. In the ancient times, the residents may only live for 30 years; but now, the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries. With a doubled life time, humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life. There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life. Hence, the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement.\n",

              "On the other hand, the aging of Population can also be a challenge to the society. When people grow old, they will be weak and get sick easily. That is the natural law which nobody can violate. Hence, when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point, the challenge to the society cannot be neglect anymore. First, the medical cost will rise greatly. If the individual or family is to pay the bill, they can be bankrupted because of illness. If the medical cost is covered by the government budget, the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government. Second, the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of the society. Japan society is now facing severe ageing problem, and the path of development is seriously slowed. There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060, only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work. The same situation is happening around the world. Obviously, rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge.\n",

When mentioning about the population ageing, media always consider it as a social problem. It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems, but in the same time, it is also a symbol of improvement. Therefore, population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement. Following are the more specific explanations.\n",

              "The rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems. Firstly, the aging population is generally of low productivity. It is a natural rule that when people grow older, their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower, so they will contribute less to the society. In addition, elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource, as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status. Furthermore, to make livings, many senior citizens go back to work field. It will also induce many problems. For example, these senior citizens may do the work less efficient and which will lead to a low effective output. To make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger, old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus. This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost. Besides, the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation. There are also some older people live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation. They can live a happy life, but actually to the society as a whole, it is a waste of social resource. Also, the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change. Above all, the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society.\n",

There are many factors which will result in the death of people, such as natural disasters, accident, diseases or suicides. Long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems. For the whole society, rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advances science and technology especially in the medical field, better social environment and a safer world. Therefore, human need to appreciate the longer life span and consider it as an achievement.\n",

For a few groups of families, there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also live with them.

              "Population ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happened. In the old times, people could easily lose their life due to hunger, disease, government, war or something else. After a country was just founded, some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger. Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen. There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food. Some people even eat their own dead children. There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals. Infectious disease is also a life killer. Not long from now SARS, as blurry as it is, attacked people all around the world. Since no one knew about this disease before, it spread around the whole world before human taking action. The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it. An atmosphere of death covered the whole world. The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere. The war kills a lot of people, which is not doubtful. After going through the WW1 and WW2, the population on the earth got much fewer.\n",

Hence, as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated, people don't risk their lives anymore. People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance. The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today. Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance, the world in all is getting better in the field. With modern machine and growing method, human don't need to worry about the amount of food anymore. All the achievements human make influence the lifespan of people. That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement.\n",

              "Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though. As the society develops, people gradually find that population ageing brings us many problems. With more and more people not working at all and receiving the allowance from the government, the society's balance is broken. It is difficult to keep economy functioning well. Times change, people change. Many young people don't view things like their parents used to do. Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before. This problem is very common in developed countries. With more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment, population ageing always comes first. The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem. For example, they encourage people to have more children by awarding them. They pull up the age to retire. No matter what measures they take, the population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies.\n",

The air cargo of the Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off. Sooner or later, the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed. All passengers and pilots were died. After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incidence, police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence. Surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future, hence to save more lives. In addition, if surveillance technology is even better developed, it can be used to detect the problem before the real accidence has happened.\n",

Therefore, surveillance technology can be used but the use of surveillance should be modified in such a way that individuals are less affected in normal life. In general, surveillance technology benefits the society and should be applied with the consideration of individuals' life.\n",

            "Risks can be analyzed if there is a record of what was happened in the past. In late nineteenth century, there was a severe air crash happening at Miami international airport. The air cargo of the Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off. Sooner or later, the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed. All passengers and pilots were died. After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incidence, police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence.

              "In modern digital world, electronic products are widely used in daily lives such as Smart phones, computers and etc. In work places, electronic devices such as computers are also inevitable to use to increase the productivity of the corporation. The convenience and high efficiency of using electronic products is being noticed by people worldwide. Some people started to think if electronic products can be further operated to more advanced utilization and replace human beings for better performances. Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) is one type of examples that has currently been implemented. In this essay, I will discuss that if surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should be used or not to track people. Personally, I agree to a large extent that surveillance technology such as RFID should be used to track people.\n",

In this fast moving society, technology is always improving to catch up the fast pace of this world and most surveillance technology is used by the police or other army usage to track people down. Although the surveillance technology is an issue in invading the human privacy, it has also brought us lots of benefits and security. There are two points supporting this argument. Firstly, security systems are improved in many areas such as school campus or at the workplace. Secondly, it makes it possible for parents to track their children and also their elderly parents. Therefore, this technology should be used to track people.\n",

              "Many of this surveillance are being implemented in the government sectors, military areas to enhance their security. It can also be found in schools and workplaces. It is useful to the government and the people in the law sector. They can maintain social control and recognize threats. Video surveillance gives people a sense of security should anything happen. In addition, it can provide all day surveillance around the school or office with little manpower needed. For example, intruders can be detected if there are any in schools or offices. This can protect the students from being in a dangerous situation in particularly for the small children who are studying in nursery. In addition, it can also prevent theft. This technology can also be a helpful tool to assist the law enforcers such as the police to collect evidences of crime after it occurred. This can increase the efficiency of solving the crime and thus decreasing the amount of criminal acts or people. With the help of the video surveillance, the chances of people performing crimes can be decreased.\n",

For example, it could be installed in personal lockers to record other's moves and actions. This technology could also be seen as invasion of human's privacy. Surveillance technology could cause everyone to feel paranoid and as if our actions are being watched. This could lead to psychological implications and thus causing many tremendous social effects that may be harmful to our society. If everyone is being watched unknowingly, it seems that our freedom of doing things is being invaded.\n",

The knowledge of installing surveillance should be taught to everyone so that crimes can be eliminated instead of increasing it. The more people using it over us, the more power they will have on us. We should respect that everyone has human rights and without other's permission, this should not be placed or implanted to anyone. We do not want to be sued infringing other's privacy, therefore, before implanting any RFID, we should ask for other's consent.\n",

And after all this scientific research result is applied to daily life, products such as RFID tracking system have become real. RFID is not only used to track products for logistical and storage purpose, it is also used to track people by doing human implants. It is unacceptable for some people in the society, however, I think this application is necessary and provides the society a lot of benefit.\n",

For example, there are always news on newspaper, report that some elderly get lost at certain place and their family are looking for him or her. The family members must be worrying a lot about the lost elderly, and with the help of police office , maybe they can find the elderly back, but it will take a long time, and a lot of energy to find someone in a country has a population about five million without knowing the exact location of that person. However, if the elderly has been implanted with RFID devices, then it will be much easier for the family to find him or her with the special serial number issued to each device differently. They can track the location of the device with the information provided by the RFID signals; therefore find the location of the lost elderly in a shorter period of time.\n",

It may be known that young children may be stolen by some agency that doing the business to trade the children. For example, they may wait in the public area and wait for parents to bring their children out but didn't pay attention to the child, so that this kind of agency may bring the child to mountain area and sell him or her with a good price. Since this is happen more often in the country which is much larger than Singapore, it is even harder or maybe it is impossible for the parents to find the child back without knowing where the child has been brought to. Since this may happen across province, and without any clue about the path that the child may went through. However, if the child has been installed with tracking device, more information will be provided along the way when the family is trying to find him or her back. Not only the details of location will be provided, but also may lead to find out the root of this kind of children trading agency and it helps to prevent more this kind of tragedy to happen on any family.\n",

Even our applications in our Iphones or other smartphones, our I-pad can easily revealed our locations. Every moves of us are being closely surveilled and followed once we stepped out of homes. Now, surveillance technology such as RFID is even invented to track people. I agree to a great extent that RFID technology shall not be easily available for the public and taken for granted.

We revealed our locations, for our friends to catch up with us, however we can never know who is watching us out there secretly. Hackers become increasingly vicious, invading into our computer system, now with radio-frequency tracking device, this may fall into inappropriate hands for the wrong reasons.

Additionally, if appropriately used, this device can contributed to our scientific findings and research.

For using as a surveillance tool, it could also be used in terms of surveys and statistics. There are also medical tools that are more of implant into the human body for the basic medical research. Moreover, the use of RFID chip in tracking clothes were also very common sight in the service industry for the huge number of clothing to be identified and tracked the location of it at any one point.\n",

This form of tracking is not harmful and disturbing to the society as it could be used to fight crimes to maintain law and order.

Although we have to admit some bad effect which is brought up by the new technology, still the advantages of the new technologies cannot be simply discarded. Back to the surveillance technology, people may say it leaks their privacy or personal life. Compared to this disadvantage, we should think about what the advantages it has make available for human beings. It can provide a safe, convenient, identifiable environment.\n",

In case, they have some accident like heart attack, the track of them will show there is something wrong. The people can get there as soon as possible to save them. For the young people, parents do not need to worry about where my kids will go after the school. By investigating the track by the surveillance technology, they can easily figure out where are their kids now and know roughly what they are doing. On the other hand, due to the track of people, the police can better know a person's daily schedule. It gives the police a better control of the criminal. All these contributions by using the surveillance technology to track make the environment safer.\n",

If we have these technologies, it will automatically confirm people's indemnification and save the effort to carry a lot of cards. Once people have their own identity confirmed, they can even need not to bring any money along with them.

The tags can be used on those who need to be took care or the beloved ones, such as a child whose parents are always concerning about his whereabouts when parents are not together with him, or maybe a lovely dog whose owner fears to lost her. In the first case, RFID can be used to help parents to surveillance their children so that they can make sure if they are at school or playing around at his friends' home, and this may help parents regulate their children's behavior.\n",

Everyday crimes are happening from time to time, and help to keep low criminal rate can be a combo of ethical, physiological and social problems. RFID can be one of the trivial ways to help dispel criminal or terroristic thoughts. Police can put tags on those that have potential intention to commit crime. Thus, when a man with a 'terrorism tag' entering a junction or a plaza full of people police should notice this and observe the man's behavior as well as checking his package to prevent him from explode TNT. Apart from preventing crime and terrorism, RFID can also be used as an evidence or alibi to help infer whether the suspect is the criminal or not.\n",

If RFID is used on everyone and running for years, surveillance centre will have a complete set of statistic data showing the movement of people from city to city, from town to town, which city is expanding more than people thought, which city is becoming less attractive. Statisticians can use these data to build up appropriate models to predict the future needs for each city so that local governments know where and when to build more infrastructures, what kind of infrastructures and what other development should be made. Economics can take advantage of these figures to predict the economic trend of local as well as the whole country. As for transportation, roads and traffic authority can easily identify where traffic jams are and advise drivers to change to suggested routes.\n",

More importantly, governments should make sure only the right people can get access to these data and they must guarantee that they will not misuse or abuse the information.\n",

              "As technology becomes more advanced nowadays, people are very exposed to the various types of technology in their daily lives. It is undeniable that technology has made ours lives and works easier and more efficient. However, when surveillance technology starts to violet the privacy of people instead of being used in a more benefitial way towards people, it is my opinion, that, such technology should rethink its way of existence.\n",

              "In fact, people are getting more exposed in public through the fast development of the virtual world-the internet. Social networks such as facebook ,Tiwtter and many others often reveal the true identities and some confidential information of the users without being realised. This already raises up a problem of privacy leakage. The surveillance technology deteriorates the problem by stalking on people's privacy openly which may arouse anger and unhappiness among people. Such incident happened in London a few years ago, when the government installed CCTV() on several streets in order to better supervise its people to keep the social order. This was supposed to be applauded by the public because it allowed fast searching on people who violated the law and caused harm to others. Instead, when news of the installment of such device was released on the newspaper, it was heavily cricised by the public. People were claiming the lost of privacy. Government had to uninstall all the devices in the end. From this case, we can clearly conclude that surveillance technology may be helpful in some way, however, when it touches the privacy of people themselves, it is unacceptable.\n",

              "From the point of humanity, it is inhumane to use such technology on human beings. We often put tags on products and animals because we treat them as goods, it is easy for trade when they are all labelled and tagged. However, human beings are not animals or any other products, they have their own thoughts and freedom. They have a full control of their own lives. If so, then why do we need human implants to trace their activities and lives when they are free to do things that they like. It is understandable that once people have human implants, they may start to behave themselves because they can be easily traced out. However, this way of curbing the crimes is so violent that will only cause people to rebel and think of ways to escape the track of such device. Afterall there will be an endless battle between the technology and human mentality. Humanity can be best seen in the case of pets rearing. Pets are supposed to be chained when they are out on the streets. However, in countries like China, where there is no law to force people to chain their pets, pets are usually left unchained and run freely on the streets. It may be dangerous as some pets are rather fierce and aggressive, however, it is the benevolence nature of human beings that we treat pets as \"human beings\", our friends that we do not want to restrict their freedom. This phenomenon is accepted by the public even by those who do not own a pet. This shows that even though there is a risk of causing harms to someone, people still prefers to bear the risk and allow their pets to have maximum freedom. Even pets are granted with freedom, people themselves certainly treat freedom as something essential.\n",

Example of this technology is RFID (radio-frequency identification) which has been proposed to track people through various means such as human implants or RFID tags on people. However, this proposal has led to fierce argument in the world over its pros and cons. I personally stand together with the population who reject the proposal.\n",

              "First of all, everyone in the world belongs to themselves who does not belong to anyone from my personal perspective. Human rights were raised up pretty frequently in the world over the past few years. Approval of RFID tracking will be seen as a violation of human rights and people will lose their most basic freedom. Would not it similar to criminals in prison but in a bigger confined space?\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Secondly, the tracking proposal will raise a safety issue. The chip identifier technology can be reproduced by anyone. It represents a query: is not everyone can view each other's information such as name and age? The leakage of these confidential information can be a sensitive issue to personal, violation of freedom and breakdown of safety. One of the examples is the storage of bank account number in the tracking chip. Criminal could identify it easily by getting a small identifier anywhere and everywhere if the tracking proposal is approved. He or she could easily touch on the designated bank account since password cracking is an easy task for most hackers.\n",

Everyone knows the internet and data transmission are very common and accessible at any time and point such as Facebook. However, people tend to express their personal feeling and idea about sensitive issues on the internet unintentionally. This action could actually generate aggressive feeling from others and violent movement could be launched onto the one with the aid of tracking tag or implant. Internet can be a convenient source to achieve the name and basic information of personal if it is hacked and the tracking proposal will facilitate the finding of designated person.\n",

However, the chip implant can be retrieved out easily and replanted onto other people and so on the tag. Mischief cases could actually cause a chaos on the checkpoint tracking record and a more serious issue if people do it ill-intentionally. For example, a wanted person can escape out easily from a country and hide in another country with this method. This tracking proposal creates a loophole in the net of justice rather than its original purpose.\n",

              "Nowadays, the improved human technology online is able to track different location for different people. For instance, face book as the well known social media platform has the ability of tracking someone's location. However, in some opinions, these auto-tracking services break the rule of privacy. Some people do not want to be tracked as they feel it is not safe. In my opinion, the developed surveillance technology can be used to track people and objects only if the tracked person agrees to receive this service.\n",

              "There exist various advantages of using the surveillance technology. The first example will be to track your personal items and prevent from losing it. We all know that there is an application on iphone called where is my iphone. It basically served to allocate your iphone's position at any single time, For instance, if someone left his phone in a certain place, he can check his phone's location by searching through the internet using another phone that has the same application if you are connected with your friends' device. You are able to find the location of your lost iphone by asking your friends as all the shared devices are able to see the location of each other.\n",

              "Another good example of using tracking technology will be to find a way to the place that someone has never being there before. For example, one person wants to visit his friends place in a new city. His friend is able to upload his location due to this advanced technology. Then, the person is able to use GPS or other auto-tracking device to find the place even he has never gone to there before. The radio-frequency device can be used on old people whose memory is not as good as young people as well. For instance, when people getting old, they begin to loss their memory and sometimes they may not remember their way to home or other place. If the old people always bring an auto-tracking device, it is much easier for the younger people to find them and it helps to guard the safety of the old people.\n",

Without the agreement, people should not able to use this technology to track others. For example, if the tracking technology is able to track everyone even strangers, this means your location at anytime is viewable to every single person online. These kind of situation will cause crime as thieves may auto track you and you are not able to run out of them. Therefore, we must agree with the statement before the technology is able to track us. At the same time, our location should be protected from seen by the strangers. All the conditions must be agreed by the person that agrees auto-tracking device to track him like, the time of tracking and who can view your location.\n",

By following the trend of improvement in technology, people can now easily tracked by using RFID (radio-frequency identification) by simply implant a RFID tags on human body. With this advantage, it will be easier for people to locate his friend or his family when they lost contact or in an urgent and also for police to investigate crimes.\n",

There are kidnaps everywhere and not all of the family can afford the ransom that acquired by kidnappers. In that case, they would have no choice but to seek for the power of loyal police. The detective will start investigate the first criminal scene and brainstorm for all the possibilities. Reality kills people in mind. There is only 10% of all the time of successfully pinpointed the kidnappers den and arrested all of them before they starts to harm the poor victim. In that sense, without a proper way to track human being, it is way too difficult to save those innocent life. Also, not only the kidnappers and the victim need to be tracked down, but also jailbreakers. Few years ago, there was a jailbreaker named Mat Selamat, one of the members of the terrorists of Osama, successfully escaped under the monitoring of a couple of cops in Singapore. That was a rare case since Singapore is actually an absolutely safe country. According to news, the police force had mobilized thousand of cops, each of them prepared on duty and patrol in an allocated place all over the country and after few months, none of them was able to find Mat Selamat and rearrested him. People fell into panic when they knew that they had lost the harmony and peace in their country and the government had no choice but keep claiming that their country is still in safety mode. If RFID comes into existence, this kind of cases can be totally avoided in no time.\n",

In spite of that, smart phone is still a device that need to be recharged its battery or else it will be just like a rigid object. Imagine when people camping in forest or hills, they will just lost all of the internet signal and also a risk that their phone running out of batteries. In that case, if they get lost or lose contact, they will be considered as the lost and eventually, they will not survive. With the help of RFID, if there is an urgent that people crying for help, they would be saved.\n",

In this mean time, surveillance technology is founded which mean that we are able to track people at every time in everywhere.

However, some of the non-governmental organizations show their point of view that object and resist implanting the RFID into prisoners' body. Their opinions are founded on the basic human rights. Prisoners' privacy is endangered due to the RFID. After they release from the prison, the movement of their whole life is controlled and known by the government.

This technology leads to a problem which is same with the prisoner issue that is the human privacy. Children are given birth by their parents; parents are responsible to take good care of them.

Children can easily be track based on the location of cell phone by parents. Compared to the human implant, tags on the products is better and more suitable. Under the products tags, children are given a significant free space as compared to the congested control by human implant.

              "As world pace becomes faster and faster, the need for maximum efficiency becomes stronger and stronger in every field. To know where a certain item locates becomes one of the ways to improve efficiency. For example, UPS can track the process of each delivery. With the information about the location of the cargo, it is much easier to prevent unexpected loss and come up with more efficient plans to save the energy and resources of the company. RFID is one of the advanced technology for tracking. Due to the small size of the equipment and the energy-saving feature, it becomes more and more popular in industries and logistics. However, it is not a reasonable idea to use RFID to track people by human implants or RFID tags on daily products like watch or clothes, it did provide convenience in a certain situation.\n",

One of the basic rights of human is the right for privacy. In any period of time, as long as we do not offense others, we should enjoy the right of privacy. However, the idea of using RFID to track people violates our need for privacy. Since RFID tags attached to the product can remain functional for a long period of time, it could be misused for surveillance purposed which are not related to the industries production or supply activities. For example, a consumer buys a product with RFID from a supermarket. As the RFID is embedded within the product, people who have the access to the information definitely can track him. However, the consumer may not be aware of the function of the tag, so this action could reveal the sensitive information of the consumers like home address, working address to someone who is not authorized to get the information. If this piece of information is misused, chances are high that the consumer would suffer loss like financial loss or even cause danger to the life of the consumer. Moreover, if the product is what one needs to use every day like clothes or shoes, then the location of one will be revealed every seconds. This is just like there is an invisible stalker behind you. It is not only scary but also illegal. Although someone would say the information is secured very well and will not be released or misused by any purpose, it is still not appropriate. We can think about this scenario: the location of us going on daily life will be sent to a computer to be processed and stored every second. Does this sound reasonable to you?\n",

Some good examples such as the Internet, computers and satellites are now quite common for humans' normal life; however, some problems also emerge, with a concern of the loss of the privacy of civilians. In the modern society privacy is a hot topic in peoples' mind. Even if the safety is the most important thing to consider in normal life, many people still want to keep their privacy in spite of existing some potential danger. The contradiction of the safety and the privacy cannot be reconciled perfectly.\n",

A report shows that the crime rate in Singapore is the lowest in the world. This is because of two reasons, one is the strict law in Singapore, and the other is the dense surveillances everywhere. During the year 2003, surveillance strategies helped Singapore beat the SARS and successfully prevented the spreading of the epidemic situation. At that time, Singapore government adopted the method to install surveillances in every patient's home to look after their actions. Much media has reported the effective measures of installing the surveillances in Singapore. Without the using of the surveillance, the epidemic situation could not be controlled strictly, and the loss caused by SARS might be many times than that in 2003 in Singapore. The benefits of the surveillance are obvious in the fighting of SARS, and this is a success example of the surveillance.\n",

In one way the surveillance help government guard civilians' property and life, in the other way the surveillance makes people feel uncomfortable under the 24 hours' monitoring. In the novel 1984, written by George Orwell, author imagines a world in which people are being watched by the big brother when they doing everything. Every words people say can be heard by the government and because of that, government know well about everyone's mind and want to wash everyone's mind and control normal people totally. It is a country without any freedom and democracy in the novel. In the reality, people are afraid of being tracking everywhere, not because of meaning to crime, but the spirit of freedom and privacy is in everyone's heart. When a husband is talking a sweet sentence to his wife, none of the couple want it to be heard by the people behind the monitors. Normal people's privacy needs government seriously considered about.\n",

The surveillance is a useful method to keep society's safe, but also kills the privacy of people in some degree. The best way to solve the contradiction is to educate people well and make them live an affluent life, and then the surveillance is no more needed. At that time, even if there is no surveillance above people's heads, there are surveillances in everyone's heart and criminals are more difficult to hide.\n",

              "Nowadays, humans live in a modern society. Around people, there are full of high technology like CCTVs, automatically sorting system for goods and different information systems. In order to bring more benefit and ensure people's safety, surveillance technology has been utilized in many aspects of fields like in UPs and DHL, these express delivery companies use surveillance technology to track their goods. It is convenient for customs to track and confirm where and how their goods are now. However, besides tracking goods for people, people begin to use this technology to track people. I do not agree this kind of behavior, because humans are different from goods, cannot treat humans as goods.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "There is no a doubt, tracking system has brought many benefits in this information age. No matter where people go, taking bus or MRT, people are under the CCTVs, it is very important and useful to track and find people. Actually, tracking system has provided people safety indemnification.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "However, tracking people are difficult and different from goods. For instance, a company has over two hundred employees scattered over different locations in Singapore, and is currently keeping tracking of working hours and overtime payments through the use of a punch card system-a system which can be open to abuses such as an employee punching the card for another. Goods are dead, but humans are alive. If one company really uses this technology to track their employees, employees will dislike and claim that their humans' right and privacy have been violated. In another a word, people will feel that the boss or the company treats them like goods, because modern people need more homage not money. So, when employees begin to conflict with this tracking system, they will find some ways to escape the tracking system like asking friends to help them to punch the cards. Finally, the company tracking system has no meaning at all, therefore tracking system is very terrible measure to control people.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In addition, tracking people system may be used by bad people in a wrong way. How to explain this problem, it means that people are not sure who are in charge of these tracking system. For example, people go somewhere, no matter taking bus, MRT or driving, they are under the CCTVs. If some bad people want to track someone for their personal purposes, by hacker technology, they can use government tracking system to do their own business. In other words, government originally hopes to use tracking system to ensure citizens safety, now it has been divulged human information. It is very dangerous for society, because people do not know who are tracking them, it must bring citizens trepidation.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "In conclusion, what I have mentioned above, we have to agree, tracking system has many benefits in different parts in humans life especially in this modern world. But tracking people is very terrible choice, it sounds like people invented a 'prison' to jail themselves, people need homage and freedom. Also tracking people is very dangerous if it has been controlled by bad men in a not good purpose. So Surveillance technology should not be used to track people.\n",

In the transportation, almost all of the people have transport cards for daily transport. Since we do not to bring cash to pay for the transportation fee, enormous time has been saved for everybody. For the society, there will be a more efficient transportation system. For the logistics, if all the products are attached to the tags, it is much easier to count and record all the products. This will make the logistic process more effective and also prevent the occurrence of product lost because of the tracking. Since the inventory management is very important for some kind of companies, this technology is playing a very significant role. The super markets are also using this technology to tag their product, which can record the conditions of all of the products in time and prevent of stealing. When checking out, the price tag will be scanned to get the total payment very quickly. This will save the customers time and also improve the profit of the market.\n",

In some kindergartens, the RFID is used to tab the children to keep a record of their attendance and whereabouts. On the condition that the kindergarten students are very young and they do not have a very sound self-conscious, this system can prevent them from lost.\n",

The first type is just say the ID card which is carried externally by the person. By using this card, our identities can be confirmed and the information in a certain institution can be kept. However, this will raise a privacy protection issue. How can it be guaranteed that our information will not be abused? Maybe this part can be resolved by using another technology. For example, the ID card can be implanted into a switch which can be controlled by the owner. When not using it, just switch off the card, then it will be just a useless paper. Another human identification is Implanting RFID chips into human body. For this part, not only the privacy problem is concerned, but the human health. Does the implanting chip definitely safe and feasible? Will it affect the normal functionality of the other organs? All of these problems are waiting to be resolved.\n",

In crime investigation, the truth of evidence is necessary, which can only be made by photos, videos or small tracks. In supermarket monitor is needed because we have to track thieves. In front of ATM we need monitor to avoid intentional crime. We need CCTV in every public corner to track suspicious. Only in this way can we get evidence of bad movement to protect others. The objective truth in CCTV is helpful and efficient in crime investigation, better than asking witness again and again to identify who is the liar.\n",

              "Secondly, surveillance technology can decrease the illegal actions effectively. Imagine there are no CCTV in public. People will act as if there is no supervision. No evidence is recorded. Cheating can be very popular in examination and stealing will seldom incur punishment. In a Chinese kindergarten, Children were always abused by a teacher but no one else knows that. Children told their parents. Some parents were too busy to take care of children while other parents did not believe what children said. The headmaster did not know how the teacher really is and she did not fire her even when some children were afraid of entering the teacher's class. After so many children were abused, people came to know the truth. Shadow was made on children's heart and there is nothing we can do to make up for it. Now people suggest that every classroom in every kindergarten should have a monitor, otherwise the teachers' action cannot be supervised. If there had been a monitor in the classroom, maybe parents and headmaster could realize earlier how severe and how bad the truth was and children could get protection earlier.\n",

In a car accident related to an official's relative, the record was modified with a new record. The person in the record had been changed with another one before it was released to the public. The modification was so obvious that people can easily recognize. In China, things like that will happen because the legal system is not sound enough. Power is concentrated in a few people. The problem of abuse of surveillance is only the problem of abuse of power. Avoiding corruption and separating power is more important than forbidding surveillance technology.\n",

There is a truth that we cannot deny which is that surveillance technology can provide a sense of safety because sometimes machine is more honest than people. We have to admit that how to prevent the abuse and how to use it reasonably depend on a sound legal system, and it means surveillance has its own restriction.\n",

However, whether a behavior is a crime is dependent on the authority. When the authority treats liberty as a crime, the society becomes terrible. It has been doubted that whether a society that is under close surveillance will be a good one to live in. Many science fictions have made good efforts in describing a future of human in which every body in society is put under close surveilliance of the governments. Surprisingly, none of these are describing the future as a bright one. In history, there were times when the government wants to secure its gorvernance so badly that its police sniffed around people like dogs, such as the Nazi Germany, the Soveit Union.

Although we are not implanted chips we are exposed under CCTV. It is a common questioned asked by lots of people that as the technology develops and we benefit from it, we are losing our privacy.

When I work, it seems I am holding my heart working since if I am doing something wrong or relax in working time. Next minute, I may have a tea with my manager. Such a nightmare owes to abuse of Surveillance technology. Although we all understand the installing of CCTV is used for protect us from criminal, nowadays, it seems to be abused too much. According to article Lawful Interception, in US, every telecommunication companies have contract with FBI, requiring them to keep the phone call record easily searchable and accessible for FBI. Moreover, as showed in many Hollywood movies, Google mail is also accessible for FBI. There are so many people in FBI, although it is under strict rule, and we cannot think ideally there will not be any one abuse its power and access those resources for private purpose and lease them out. Leasing of private information, even though it only happened one time, but one is too many for an individual. Moreover, the money spend on telephone call record is $1.8 million per year.\n",

              "As the fast growing of electrical technology, people have been trying to adopt more and more advanced technology into our life to make full use of it. Many advantages have been shown in the areas like politics. Because of the surveillance technology, more and more things are under track and more and more clues can be used. However, disadvantages have also been gradually disappeared as with the fruits people are enjoying. That is to say, there are more and more doubts raised by the public about the surveillance technology. From the view of my point, I think the application should only be authorized by people in some specific fields like politics and public security.\n",

              "Firstly, privacy will not be protected if everything is under monitoring. We cannot imagine our every move is under track and there may be someone who is staring at you from some place through the monitor. That sounds like we are naked in front of the public, there is no secret and even privacy for us. Perhaps that the surveillance is installed for the sake of safety, but actually it conversely make us have a lack of safety. Therefore, the surveillance technology cannot be casually used.\n",

              "Secondly, it may be used by lawbreakers. There is no denying that every coin has two sides. The technology also applies. On one side, we can use it to ensure that something is under our control to reduce the rate of crimes. On the other side, the technology can also be probably used by the lawbreader to commit crimes. And once this happens, privacy does not exist any more and people's life is under great threaten. Therefore, this technology carries great risk when we can only see the advantages that has been appeared.\n",

              "Thirdly, it is also a waste of time and money if we use it in our daily life. Say, a person whose salary is 2000 dollars per month. And he spends 1000 dollars to install the surveillance system in his house. Then if his house got stolen, the perhaps he can use the surveillance to get his money back. However, if nothing happened inside his house, then the surveillance becomes useless, and he will also feel very uncomfortable because his every move is being supervised. Therefore, for ordinary people, there is no need for them to use this technology. Otherwise, it is just a waste of resources.\n",

              "From the reasons above, we can see that the surveillance technology takes great danger with it so that we cannot apply it to our daily life. However, we can take the essence and reject its dross. That is to say, we can use it in some specific and special areas such as public security and politics. These fields are special because of the job category, and the need to be open to the public, so the disadvantages will not be shown. Contrarily, it can help to supervise the public figures in politics and track the offenders in security. Therefore, the surveillance technology should not be used except for some specific jobs.\n",

However, in this very non-ideal world where corruption is abundance, wide usage of such surveillance technology and accurate tracking is potentially a dangerous, perverted and deadly weapon.

In the movie, the spy agent accesses the public street cameras to track Jason's Borne whereabouts. This clearly illustrates how a corrupted government may breach its civilians' privacy.\n",

These statistical analyses will give governments more accurate information when drafting policies. An example of making an good informed decision is the story of the planning and constructing of a walking path, where the government has a lack of information and decides that the people needs a proper concrete walking path and builds one at a randomly location. However, they could have built the walking path on a dirt path that has been walked out by the people themselves.

              "With the development of technology, we have more advanced method to track people in today's society. Surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) is frequently used by the police to track people who are considered suspicious. However, the using of surveillance technology is usually done secretly, and a debate has been aroused today that whether surveillance technology should be abandoned. Some socialists argue that installing surveillance device on people offends human rights and should be totally abandoned. However, people who are taking security job assert that surveillance technology is the most effective way to track people and make it easier for them to track those suspicious people so that they can do their work much more effectively. In my point of view, surveillance technology should still be used to track people at present since there are no better solutions.\n",

Although that method may invade certain people's right and privacy, but in exchange for that we can get a safe and peaceful society. If the surveillance technology is abandoned, it makes the police very difficult to track the suspicious people and can have little control of those people who are dangerous to the society. For example, without surveillance technology, the murders can escape much more easily since no one knows their position. Without surveillance technology, the suspicious people might actually commit a murder and the murder can be much more serious if the police cannot arrive in time to help out. On the other hand, the application of surveillance technology serves as a warning to the murders and they might not commit more murder since they might be afraid of being tracked by the police. If that technology is abandoned, it may trigger more bad people to commit murder or stole things since it is very difficult for the police to track them and they have a high possibility of not being punished by the law. Therefore, the continuation of using surveillance technology is really necessary.\n",

With the popularization of surveillance technology, a more concise and more complete regulations of using that is highly needed. For example, making ordinary people not allowed to use that and do not let the surveillance device accessible to the ordinary people so that abuse usage of surveillance technology can be avoided, which is also a effective way to protect human right. Only police should be allowed to use surveillance technology and such technology can only be used to help tracking the murders or people suspected. With proper use of surveillance technology, surveillance technology can be a good tool for the police, and also benefit all the society.\n",

              "In the modern society, public surveillance is becoming a normal phenomenon. In the United States, after the horrible attack on 11 September, the US congress passed the Patriot Act, which is mainly to increase domestic surveillance, to counter against the terrorists. However, although these bureaucratic actions prevent another similar attack from happening again, the act is widely criticized for its violation over individual privacy. With the development of surveillance technology such as RFID, spy on the population can be much easier, which will create even worse scenery for the citizens. In this paper, the incorrectness of using technology such as RFID to track people will be proved by the discussion of violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian rule of the authority.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "First, the violation of privacy will be dramatically increased. Typically, the RFID tags are small devices with a read-only chip. The regular distance of data exchange can be several meters. Once such chip is loaded with personal information and implants in individuals, all the information about his or her life can be recorded. Some supporters may argue that it will more convenient to use RFID for identification in place like airport and check point. However, the fact is that such technology will create check points everywhere. Furthermore, such tracking on individuals is done without permission of the subject person. That is to say, people will be surveilled for every moment without awareness. In such situation, individuals will lose their basic privacy.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "Second, when technology like RFID is widely used, there will be a trend to misuse such technology. An important feature of RFID is the minimal security. Since it is read-only, the card cannot protect itself. Moreover, almost every one can gain access to the card reader as the reader requires only simple technology. Then, if a business man wants to defeat his competitor, he can just buy a reader and spy for commercial secrets. Hence, once RFID is widely used, people are very likely to spy on each other, which will destroy trust, respect and many moral values.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "Third, to use the surveillance technology will enhance the totalitarian power of the authority. The government is supposed to serve the people. However, once the government gathers too much power, the democracy may be turned into totalitarianism, and such surveillance technology provides the measures. Spying and collecting excessive information of individuals is the first step. When government is able to find out all the precise information about its citizens, it can gradually apply control over them. Consequently, the government is very likely to turn to be a totalitarian authority, which will be the worst scenery and tragedy for every single citizen.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "All in all, surveillance technology such as RFID should not be used to track general population for the violation of privacy, the trend to misuse such measures and the enhancement of the totalitarian power of the authority. Privacy must be respected, and power over other should be controlled. Without such surveillance technology, we can still live a better future.\n",

              "With the development of the science and technology, people nowadays are living under various surveillances, for example, CCTVs can be seen almost everywhere in public area. Recently, a new coming surveillance technology called radio-frequency identification which is RFID for short has caused heated discussions on whether it should be used to track people. Some people think RFID should be banned out of privacy consideration. However, As far as I am concerned, using RFID to track specific people can be very helpful in situations such as scientific exploration, rescue and police events.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "During scientific exploration, especially the geographical ones, the tracking is very important. This tracking will help scientists to better get their result and clear exploration route information will also be useful for post-research when scientists come back. In addition, people who research in biodiversity will also need to be tracked. When these scholars are on the field journey, they also have to relate their observation with their route information; this is when RFID is of great significance. In addition, field journeys are sometimes very dangerous. Observers are likely to go into the rural forests or mountainous areas. Their safety may face huge challenge. For this kind of situation, RFID will help a lot.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Actually, not only for scientific observations but also during adventure journeys or travelling, RFID can defend human beings from harm. Firstly, knowing where the travelers are and may going can assist them to know what the surroundings will be like and they can prepare better to protect themselves or they can change directions to avoid the potential danger. Furthermore, by telling the geographical position of the people, RFID can accelerate the rescue process and will improve the survival rate of the victims. During the rescue, every second is valuable!\n",

By getting the track of the suspensors, police officers can decide who the criminal exactly is sooner and easier to gain the truth behind the criminal event. Furthermore, knowing where the criminal is will also simplify the chasing process. Policeman can just go to the certain place and chase the criminal. Besides, tracking people with potential danger will be helpful for the safety department to predict the harm and better avoid the problem.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Some people may argue that using RFID to track people will leave out individuals' privacy. Nevertheless, the activities I mentioned above are related little to privacy issues. Firstly, for scientific exploration, rescue and police events, the privacy factors are far less important than the individual or social safety and scientific results. In addition, for observation journeys and traveling, we only need to use RFID on some certain individuals and they will agree with this action for their own benefit.\n",

By using this technology reasonably, it will assist people to walk faster and further in the long and rough civilization developing path.\n",

              "With the development of science and technology, surveillance technology is playing its role in people's lifes. It monitors anybody's movement or activity, and enables us to identify suspects involved in any misdoing which violates the law, etc. When surveillance technology like RFID brings lots of convenience to our life, some people argue that this kind of technology actually makes us feel unsafe. Personally, I think surveillance technology such as RFID (radio-frequency identification) should not be used to track people, for the benefit it brings to me cannot match the concerns it causes.\n",

              "It has been quite a long time since someone raises the importance of the right of privacy. Without doubt, surveillance technology is going against the right since it leaks out people's information without getting their permission. When the technology is not so well developed, it may not be a big problem for leaking limited information. While as it becomes highly developed, it is very scary to realize that this technology actually tells lots of people where did you go and what did you do. It gives you the feeling that all people are watching a movie, and you are the hero whose every movement including using the toilet is under others observation, just like what was showed in the movie The Truman Show which chronicles the life of a man who is initially unaware that he is living in a constructed world, broadcast to billions of people.\n",

For example, thieves can easily find out the best time to visit our houses and kidnappers can take away our kids every time if they are informed of everyone's location. That will also cause more social concerns.\n",

Every technology is born with its advantages and its shortcomings just like nuclear power or weapons. If we cannot choose the proper way to use it, we taste the bad consequences of it. As to surveillance technology which is not only inefficient enough in improving our life quality but also violating our right of privacy, I think we should not use it to track people.

Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually. The rising expectancies are considered as a challenge as less workforce is resulted if population ages; high burden for governments to support the sources of living for excessive ageing people. However, it is considered as an achievement as there is low competency in workforce. Rising life expectancies is a two-sided sword which is both a challenge and an achievement.\n",

This results in an unbalanced ratio between young people and older people. This is a challenge as it reduces the productivity of countries, and hence affecting the productivity of the world. Globally, manpower is lacking. Although current world is a digital world which more machines are used to replace manpower, manpower is required to operating these machines so that they can better functioned. In countries like Singapore, manpower is the only natural resources available which Singapore can invest on as she does not have enough lands to build farms and factories. In addition, Singapore focuses more on developing its tertiary industry which are mainly consisting of services. People are needed. More importantly, Singapore wants to be a knowledge based country, more highly educated people are required.

In general trend, elderly people are easy to be ill as compared to young capable adults. More healthcares are needed for elderly people than young adults. In most countries healthcare are provided freely from government. As a result, government need more taxed from companies in order to have enough money to provide healthcare to elderly people. Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65. This is an age which most people is retired and has no sources of incomes. Their purchasing power is low. In an aged population, low spending affects the economic growth. Companies are in trouble if they cannot earn sufficient money to sustain their business and they also need to pay high taxes to the government.

Therefore, people are generally less stressed in working. Life is more enjoyable for young adults. Rising life expectancies also indicates that standard of living is improved for majority of people. Healthcare is better than in the past. They can live longer as they can afford high healthcare fares to maintain their health to a better condition.\n",

              "With the ageing population, many countries are facing the same challenge as to build safety houses, facilities to cater to the old aged. After a certain age, they will have to retire. The challenge of many ageing countries will rise when no new generation could take over their place in that particular trade. First, I will discuss on the challenge of having an ageing population such as building more facilities and hospitals that will be needed when the population starts to age and jobs which have no young people taking over which can lead to economic downfall. Secondly, I will discuss the ageing population as an achievement where they implement healthy lifestyles and good eating habits.\n",

              "When people start to age, many diseases will surface up un-noticing. Therefore, for the welfare of the ageing population, more old age hospitals will have to be built. Land space will be limited when more hospice are build to take care of the elderly people. With illnesses surfacing and the increase in ageing population, increasing amount of nurses and doctors will have to be present. However, not many young people are passionate about helping the society or even helping the elderly. Hence, the country will face a big challenge as to take care of the elderly. In addition, retirement is a must in some countries. This could cause a drastic fall in their economy as if the younger generation could not take over their work, no one will continue. It is thus a big challenge to the country as there is no one boosting their economy.\n",

The more old people the country has, the more experience they will be as most elderly people can share their old experiences with the younger generation and making them not make the same mistakes as them. This will help the country to move forward rapidly. The more exercise or any other forms of work out can prolong the lifespan of people. It also indicates that the foods the people eat are nourishing and can decrease the amount of illness that can cause death, thus living longer. Food can be a big part of our lives. Eating the right amount of healthy or junk food can be a cause of having a longer or shorter lifespan. An example will be in Korea. It is said that kimchi can reduce the chances of having cancer and in addition, the people will have a good skin complexion. True enough, their population is ageing but people there can live very long due to the food they are consuming. Thus, food can play an important role to the population.\n",

As the standard of living increases, the affordability of high quality healthcare services and medical technologies, which have advanced over the decades, among the general public has become increasingly available. People of the nations are likely to be well-taken care of, partly because of the various healthcare incentives and schemes provided by the respective government. In the following, I will take Singapore as the case study as a reference to my discussion.\n",

This means, having an elderly at home is equivalent to having a gold at home. Where every home houses an elderly, the future generations can learn and carry on their traditional and morale values. Where filial piety and respect for the elder are highly emphasized in Chinese traditions, the children can learn to respect and interact with their grandparents from a young age and so as for their parents. With good communication and interaction, an elderly can guide the young with valuable lessons in life. An individual is an unit of the society, every good individual thus is a precious contribution to the society and nation's growth.\n",

A long-lived and healthy individual is sometimes being related to the good standard of living and healthcare services that one received. In another words, it indicates that the national healthcare system is effective, well-managed by the Government. This gives credits to the Government's medical and healthcare schemes. Thus, rising life expectancy can be seen as an achievement of the Government's well-planned or managed schemes. However, this shall not be entangled with the idea that high life expectancy equates of a nation's provision of quality healthcare benefits and livings for the senior citizens.\n",

In order to cope with the ageing population that pulls down or hinders the economic development, more physically capable and young workforces are required in the society. If failed to fulfil this requirement, this will lead to more financial strains such as increased tax imposed on the societal or company working groups. This can cause more societal issues such as lower satisfaction of working groups towards the government, decreasing birth rates where people could not afford the children expenses of their upbringings and educational fees, that adds on more burdens and worries for the government.\n",

              "Rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement. We should separate it into two aspects. The first one is that rising life expectancies can be considered as a challenge. The second one is that rising life expectancies can also be considered an achievement. They are not contradicting with each other. In my opinion, the challenge interception is to make comparison in the cross direction, which is comparing the current situation with the assumed situation. On the other hand, the achievement perceiving is to make comparison in the wire direction, which is comparing the current situation with the historical situation in the past. So, in the following, I will clarify these two different views for rising life expectancies.\n",

              "For the first part, rising life expectancies is a challenge. We should image that when the life expectancies are raised up; this will mean that the average age for the population in nation wise or globally is also rising. The number of the older people will increase to make the average life expectancies higher. For these older people, the society need man power and all kinds of resources to provide a better life for them. Sometimes, older need more man power and resources than normal young people. However, these older people usually contribute less or nearly have no productivity for the society. We have to say that the older people are becoming a black hole for the entire society in terms of man power and resources. So the dilemma takes place when there are more people who have a higher age. Not only has the family member of the old people, but also the government needed to spend a lot of effort to handle such situation. This is the interpretation of challenge for rising life expectancies.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "For the second part, rising life expectancies is also an achievement. The achievement is some kind of a comparison with the history in the past. In the ancient time, due to the less development of science and technology, people had less medicine or medical equipment and took less care for their healthy. Hence people died of various diseases. On the other hand, there are not sufficient materials or ways to improve people's daily life. People do not know how to protect their tooth from becoming decayed tooth. These small things makes the quality of people's life less enjoyable than today. Bad mood cannot give them a longer time of life. Due to all these reasons, people died quite early, which results in a low life expectancy. So, the mark for how long is the life expectancy is indicating how well people is living. In that sense, rising life expectancies can be considered as an achievement.\n",

Besides, we should not forget the responsibility on our shoulder, the older people. We should try our best to take care of them as if we are the ones who are old. In such a situation, the society can develop in a harmonious and healthy way. We just take the challenge and enjoy the achievement.\n",

Life expectancy is a figure that reveals the average lifetime and can be used as an indicator to measure up to what degree is the population ageing problem. However, there are situations where we have to consider the rising life expectancy as a challenge and an achievement.\n",

Cancers, as a major group of killing diseases, is often beyond current medication to get fully healed. Once cancers are too late to discovered, one is deemed to death at a later stage. Other diseases such as mental disorder and heart trouble are also top killers, the current medication does have methods to treat the patient, but risks still come along. Apart from diseases themselves, deficiency of medication system coverage and inefficiency during the treatment process can also restrict to make lifespan longer. Patients in many developing and less developed countries, especially African countries, are suffering from simple and easy-to-heal diseases such as cold and flu and probably at the end of the day it becomes the end of their life, albeit they could have been treated well if they were in a country where medication system has been completed and doctors and nurses are standing by to cure these people. To raise life expectancy, one of the questions is how to upgrade the current medication system. Government should help encourage the breakthroughs as well as complete medication system.\n",

Compared with the world of ancient Rome or China where almost no machines are involved, people nowadays are producing batches and batches of merchandises in factories. Machines have replaced a bunch of coolies and heavy labor. Cars and trucks diminish the redundancy of long time shipment. As a result, people have more time to enjoy advantage of modern life. One can easily travel to the other half of the globe to see beautiful scenery that one dreams for his lifetime. One can also easily see his deeply loved one through internet from miles away. More importantly, they can share their ideas of how to keep healthy through Internet, to make more interested people get involve and find ways to make life longer and more wonderful. The development of technology brings people joy, making things easier and this may be one of the achievements.\n",

The condition of the living environment is also improved that people are able to live in more hyginenic places. The improvement in technology also eases people's lives by replacing all the manual labourous works with easy and simple machine operative works. Due to the three major factors stated above, people are no longer exposed to disease-breeding living environments, are able to cure their diseases considered fatal last time and do not need to do much labourous work. The rising life expectancies best prove these improvements and have definitely written a new chapter on the history human civilisation.\n",

As the aging population grows, the young and more energetic people are subject to support more people of old age. This creates a huge social burden to them and might cause some of them leave the country when the burden becomes unbearable. This would result in the lose of manpower in a country. Another aspect would be that as the young people feel it is hard to feed the old people in their families and themselves, they would choose not to give birth to any child in order to reduce the burdens on themselves. This would result in decrease in birth rate of a country which is a very serious problem,especially in more developed countries as the population has already reached a minimum. Government will be burdened by the growing aging population as well because it needs to set aside a great amount of money to provide better welfare of the old people because they are in urgent need of it. Less money will be left to develop the country and explore into new areas of business. This would result in economic retardation and stagnation of a country.\n",

On the other hand, people demand better quality of service and advanced technology such as newer I-Pad model. In fact, these rising demands require a stronger working force who is active and higher productive than the past. However, ageing population is a phenomenon opposite to it. Ageing population leads to a working force composed of larger percentage of elders who are lower productivity and thus unable to meet the expectancy.\n",

In addition, the younger generation eager to start their own family at another place rather than staying together with family. This phenomenon increases the demand of land property and subsequently affects their price and size together. Increasing size of population also leads to the problem in food supply. The production of food is showing a lower growth rate compare to population's growth rate which will end up with insufficient food in the future.\n",

              "People's average age has become longer compared to the past. From one perspective, it shows that the medical technology has improved over the years as people now are able to treat different deceases. From another perspective, there are more and more elder people but less younger ones, the increase in population age has weaken the labor force and so on. In my opinion, the increase in population age is more a challenge than an achievement.\n",

              "Firstly, the population ageing can be definitely viewed as an improvement of human culture and technology. Compare the technology today and the past, we can see that a lot of deceases are treatable, the number of people that died because of the deceases that is not treatable decreases. The fast development of medicine and technological product makes people's life much healthier compare to the past. Moreover, the increased technologies help people to overcome different natural disasters. People are able to predicate some disasters like the earth quake and do the prevention beforehand.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "Although the increase in population ages shows that people have increased knowledge and technologies, it should be considered as a challenge more than an achievement. The technology is always improving and it never stops, and the lifespan of people are getting longer as well. Thus, we should not compare now with the past but we need to worried about the future problems that caused by this situation.\n",
              "</p>\n",
              "<p>\n",
              "The first challenge is the decreasing number of new born. As the population ageing are growing, as people getting old, they need to be cared by others and are not able to contribute as the same as they were young. If the number of old people is too much and there is lesser number of younger people, it will affect the growth of the whole society as the young workers are less, the productivity and technology improvements will be less. At the same time more people are needed to take care of the old ones, which gives the younger generation extra works. The second challenge will be the shortage of natural resources. As we know that population of human continues in growth year by year, we are using the non-recoverable natural resources in everyday life, for example, the oil, people's life and technology improvement are not able to continue without the usage of oil. However, these natural resources are not renewable. We do not consider much for our offspring. Ever imagine one day that no natural resources are left what will be the life of our next generation. The increase in population means the larger the natural resources are needed and people have to think out some idea like to prevent using too much natural resources.\n",

              "In conclusion, the increase in population age shows both the human technology achievement and the new challenges like lack of young generation. We have to consider more about our future generation, aware of the problem that over aging brought to us and come up with ideas to solve these challenges.\n",

An improvement in engineering and medical science had been valued since humanism arises. Studies have shown that the average life span or human being rising gradually over years, in the sense that the improvement of global technology in medicine helps human to live longer and enjoyed the world even more. In spite of that, people should aware that the power of science is not almighty, life will still go to their last page without revelation. Since not all of the human being is going to be a doctor, people relies the skills of treatment of doctors and hence, they start to ignore the maintenance of their own health.\n",

In the past, when people injured or fall into sickness, there is no guarantee that the people will get well treatment and fully recovered, therefore people can easily die by infected of a small disease. With the grand medical skill we are having nowadays, human lived longer and hence, a great increasing in population. It would be great if life expectancies keep rising up day by day, but in reality, it does not seem to be so easy. Firstly, although the treatment is reliable, people would still need to have the awareness of their own health condition. There are millions of doctor all over the world, but there are billions of patients as well. Nowadays, the pressure from the head of a company towards those employee caused that people has to be fully concentrate in their jobs and because of that, people starts to ignore their health condition and relies on treatment and supplement. Pressure can really cause sickness just like virus and germs and it is more like a chronic disease. It is like a key that open up the gate of human body defend system and provide a cleared path for other disease to attack in. Therefore, when the era is improving itself, the disease does it too. It is a big challenge to eliminate all the disease in the world and keeping the life span to grow as people do sick every moment.\n",

Their lives are becoming meaningless and a lot of them had chosen to suicide without giving troubles to the others. Nowadays, things have changed. Disabled people walks with artificial legs, man can getting pregnant, even the sexual of a human can be changed just by doing simple surgery. It is really a great achievement in enhancement of technology which should be recorded in history.\n",

In the social science report last year, this number will further increase to 90 years old in 2080s due to the advance medical technology and better living standard.\n",

It may cost higher social cost burden which further leads to the allocation of funds in government yearly budget. Medical expenses, EPF and accommodation are the costs which directly involved to the old people. It is responsibility of government to ensure the living of old people. Otherwise, there are more and more people staying at the street and destroy the good view of Garden City. In addition, it is also a challenge for government, family and parents to educate their children about the moral of filial. With the moral of filial, most of the children will take care of their parents after their retirement life. It is to prevent from sending them to old folk's house and do not visit them at all. We also do not want to see the happening of worst things that parents are dropped by children along the streets and let them die themselves. It may be a challenge but also golden opportunity to educate their children properly to prevent the undesired outcomes.\n",

However, among the under-developed countries, developing countries and developed countries, we found that there is longest life span in the developed countries follows by the developing countries and the shortest life span in under-developed countries. The observation means that the more developed the countries, the longer the life span of citizens. In the other words, it also can be said that it is an achievement to obtain an ageing population.

With the existing of experience, we can do the work more quickly without sacrifice the standard and quality.

              "In 1712, Watt renovated the steam machine which increases the efficiency of the fuel. This activity can be marked as the start of the first technology revolution. As the technology develops faster and faster during 301 years, people not only enjoy more and more materials but also more and more health care which provides convenience in our daily life. This significantly raised people's average life expectancy. However, as the life expectancy of people rises, population ageing problem becomes more and more severe as a global phenomenon. Studies have shown that the current average life span is over 65. Projections of the United Nations indicate that the population aged 60 or over in developed and developing countries is increasing at 2% to 3% annually. As the rise of life expectancies can be interpreted as a measure standard of the pace of technology development, it can be seen an achievement of human being. However, as the energy and resources use up, more and more adult people without sufficient power to produce crowd on earth will aggravate the ageing problem, so the rise of life expectancies can also be seen as a challenge.\n",

              "As we are human who are different from other animals, we have some basic rights like right to privacy, right to live, right to have a family and so on. Among these basic rights, the most important one is the right to live. During the less developed times, due to disasters like droughts ,floods or severe contagious disease like black deaths, people at that time could lose their property and lives easily since they do not have enough power to protect themselves and restore their life in a short time. However, as the technology develops, it increased people's mobility and productivity so as life expectancies. As we can use the resources with maximum efficiency, we can enjoy more and more life material than any time of human society. Even when the disaster comes, we can restore the order of our life in a relatively short time than before. For example, the tsunami in Tohoku of Japan in 2011 is \"the toughest and the most difficult crisis for Japan in the 65 years after the end of World War II\" as CNN commented. (CNN, 2011) However, only one year has passed, most of the survivors have come back to their normal life although with a sad memory. This is not imaginable during less developed times. With the strong back support of technology, the rises of life expectancies can be seen as an achievement to the development of our human society.\n",

              "However, along with the increase of life expectancies, ageing problems becomes more and more severe. Two of the most important causes of ageing problem is the increasing longevity and declining fertility. The increasing longevity is due to fast development of the society so as the living pressure. The increasing pressure will lead to the declining fertility. As people who are incapable of production become more and more, our society follows a downward trend. Moreover, as we use up more and more resources, what we have left may not enough for us to live on if we do not have enough human resource to do research of developing new technology. Therefore, the increase of life expectancies is also a great challenge.\n",

Nowadays, population aging is becoming a problem especially in the developed countries. Now in Singapore, we can feel that there are more old people than young people if you go to Chinatown. Population ageing also has brought us a question on whether we should raise life expectancies, it is challenging also can get some achievement.\n",

              "In the first place, rising life expectancies could cause resources challenge. In some very small and developed regions and countries like Singapore and Hong Kong, if people still increase the humans' life, but for these small developed regions, the resources are very limited especially land. Because the land is limited, so the average land for one person is very small already. Some years, there is a report on Hong Kong citizens living situation, in a small room there are eight people, they cannot do anything in the room, only can sleep and the air in the room is very bad. So rising life expectancies will make the world population larger, more people shall the limited resources. In economic, we can use GDP to explain the challenge, if GDP is low, it shows that most of people are living in a hard life, life quality is bad, then it will cause the terrible society problem, at last, it will happen the society disturbance. The reason why it will happen is because people have violated the natural regulation.\n",

              "On the other hand, rising life expectancies could bring some achievements. People's life quality has been better now, in order to continue improving, people have begun to consider how to raise their life. Because the life and health are most significant, people have their own reasons to hope living longer. On medicine, people have done a lot of researches on life science. Also people begin to realize the importance of the environment, how to protect people from the harmful air. So according to the humanism, people should make contribution to rising the humans life, because people should consider the feelings if one day when you are becoming older and older, so respecting life should be considered carefully.\n",

              "In addition, now there appears a contradiction if rising life expectancies, it will lead a resources problem. However, based on the humanism, humans are different from the animals, people should respect every life. In my opinion, I think we should study balance it well, one side we should continue to make efforts to raise the humans life, one side, we should consider using asking some sick old men whether if they want to take euthanasia.

As our society develops, the people have a much higher living standard, which will reduce the chance of getting disease. Besides, as the development of the technology, the medical therapy also has a tremendous progress. Many diseases which are incurable in the past can be cured now. Therefore, the patient will have a bigger chance to be cured and survive. Both of the two reasons will decrease the number of died people annually. On the other hand, the birth rate in many countries keeps decreasing, whose figure is the lowest record comparing to previous figure. Maybe, it is because the modern society is become more and more competitive, the parents are paying much attention and importance to their career. They do not want to bother to spend so much time in raising and nurturing children. Maybe that's one reason for the reducing of the birth rate.\n",

This survey evidently shows that big achievement has been made in the medical area and people's living standard has been improved. It also indicates that the economy has been dramatically grown. Yet, do not be confused by this superficial amount and achievement. The issue facing us is more challenging and tricky.\n",

The most important part is health care and old-age pension. As elderly people, they need more money for health care than the younger. Government should also make a bigger amount of pension expenditure.\n",

They will be more vulnerable to be hurt or get some injures. Therefore, some measurement and education about this should be taken by the government and the surrounding people to ensure the security of the old people.\n",

Nonetheless, the issues it brings out are more worthy to be considered. More elderly people will bring a big extra burden to the society and government. More facilities and service will be needed to fulfill these requirements. Definitely, we should perform these demanded duties very responsibly and carefully. Whereas, for the sustainable development of the country and the earth, some measurements and policies should be carried out to control and change this phenomenon.\n",

              "It is natural that rising life expectancies is regarded as an achievement. The goal of every species of living things is reproducing to increase the quantity of this species. Humankind is not an exception. People with rising life expectancies can ensure large population and large species of human being. It is more secure for us because in potential sense we think with longer life expectancy it is harder for people to die out. Rising life expectancies is also an evidence of progress of modern medical technology. For ancient people it is miraculous to achieve 70 years old, but now it is general. Rising life expectancies can bring us more skilled work force because we can delay the retirement time to extend working time for each person. Longer working period means the old person who is more skilled does not need to retire and no fresh men will take over. Thus it is more efficient to keep more skilled people for long time rather than training fresh men.\n",

              "We talk about the first possibility. If there are less young people and more old people, as in both Singapore and China, when elderly retire, there are not enough young people who can make up for the new available positions. Thus there will be a lacking in labor force, which will lead a decreasing speed of development of the country. Many factories will be deserted and many companies will go bankruptcy, and thus people's life condition will definitely get worse. The past 30-year rapid development of China is connected with the large population, but due to the \"only child\" policy, we have no benefits from large population in the future. With low birth rate, Singapore is bringing in foreigners to maintain the population to maintain the efficiency and development of the country.\n",

Expansion of population cannot continue like that because the resources are limited, and we will end with dying out after using up all resources.\n",

Ageing problem is in essence a problem of worsening bodies. With increasing age, people become more prone to disease and injury, and more difficult to recover. Without advanced health care system, aged people have higher rate of death. In fact, this was the major limitation of people's average life span in the past.

Such environmental hazards come from various aspects. A major source of the hazards is the pollution. A place with heavily polluted air and water is by no means a good habbitat and will bring a lot of health problems for its residents, among which aged people and children will be harmed most.

In China, there is a famous saying that there are things should be celebrated, one is red and one is white. Here, red thing means marriage and white means someone passing away. The first time when I read this saying I am confused why someone passing away is a good thing that people should celebrate and later I was told that in past, it is hard to live longer than 60 years old and even though you are very lucky to live longer than 60 years old, you will suffer a lot from illness or the sadness for your young relatives passing away, so people think it is worth celebrating since they will not suffer any longer. It is very hard to understand such a feeling as people felt in the past. Now, technology and science develops at an unbelievably fast pace. There is lots of illness that is thought incurable in the past vanished in the world. Even though people with cancer, which is still hard to cure, now have more chance to survive and have a longer time to live. Besides illness, the improvement of technology generates more food both in quantity and in quality. In the same time, it also frees a great amount of labor. Now people not only can have food to survive but also enjoy high-level food and even pursuing the tasty and luxury one. It is a break-through of technology and science, and an outstanding achievement of human wisdom.\n",

              "Making use of our smart brain to improve our quality of life and give us more time to enjoy the life, it sounds like perfect, but we must face to the reality -- there is no Utopia. Before people find another planet to live, the earth is the only habitat for us, and hence the limit of its capacity to support livings, it is the limit of the quantity of people that can live. People's lifetime rising means that the time of the cycle of generation rises. Furthermore, thanks to the development of technology, that the birth rate is increasing while the death rate is decreasing accelerates population aging and increasing. To our disappointment, now the technology is not so advanced that it can generate all human beings by using limited resources. Moreover, the global population aging means that the total amount and quality of labor is decreasing. Before robots can fully replace labor, the decreasing of generating power indicate less creativity and less goods available for us to use. It is such a challenge that human being cannot avoid and must solve. The only way is to develop technology but the chance to develop is based on people's wisdom and creativity, which is decreasing due to population aging.\n",

Therefore, the only way available for us to destroy such a balance is accelerating the progress of development so to increase the capacity of our planet.\n",

Moreover, the life expectancies have also been raised due to the developing of the economy. However, while we are enjoying the fruits carried be the development of the economy, we are also facing a global problem --- population ageing. There is no doubt that this problem has become more and more serious which have gradually influenced the tendency of the population as well as the source allocation. Therefore, the rising life expectancies can be considered both a challenge and an achievement.\n",

              "On one side, we cannot deny that it is a great achievement with the rising life expectancies. The reason why the life expectancies have aroused is that we are becoming more and more clever due to the evolution, and we are becoming richer and richer due to the knowledge we have learned. Since that we get richer, we have more money to use to live a more comfortable life. Therefore, because of the great efforts we have made, we have been living a better life. And that is what we are striving for. So the rising life expectancies can be regarded as a proof of what we have made to combat for ourselves.\n",

Since that we have a better living circumstances and higher living quality, we are leading a longer life. This seems to be a gratifying progress at the first sight. However, during the process of making development to our life, we decide to reduce the rapid growth of population by adopting the measure of controlling birth so that the shortage of source allocation can also be slowed down. This also works and we have also seen the effect. Then there comes a problem. Because that the birth rate is reduced while the death rate is also reduced, the percentage of the elderly is increased while that of the youth is decreased. So the population is getting more and more aged. But the primary labor force as well as the work force is from the youth. That is to say, the population aging has aggravated the burden of the society. Then we can see that the rising life expectancies can also be viewed as a challenge for us to face.\n",

However, the achievement that we have made is far more than the problems caused by the challenges. The significance of our existence is to leading a meaningful life and combat for the development of our world. There is no absolute perfect way, so we have done a good job on the road. Therefore, we need to continue on our striving as try our best to reduce the adverse impact that is carried.\n",

Advance healthcare is also a major factor in prolonging the individual's existence on earth. Examples of how advance health in the city has raised life expectancies are such as antibiotics, the cure of poliomyelitis, and better and cleaner surgical procedures. All of these are human achievements in their own rights that have resulted in rising life expectancies, and hence they also illustrates why rising expectancies can be considered an achievement.\n",

The reasons are mainly due to the threat of fierce animals like tigers and lions, the lack of food, the lack of hygiene knowledge, and also very importantly, the lack of medicine. With the development of society, of the past thousands of years, the technology is progressing and the concern for health is arising, so that higher life expectancies are achieved. With more advanced technology in medicine area, more and more diseases can be cured so that much more death is avoided. Since people get higher education today, increasing amounts of people switch from fast food to organic food and have a balanced diet so that their chance of getting cancer is lowered.

However, the need for food is also increasing, so that the competition might become even more frightening. What's worse, since people are unsatisfied with the amount of space and food they have, violence might take place more frequently. Many violence happened in Middle East is just due to the fight for food and water resource. With more people living on the earth, pollution might become even serious, and as a result of pollution, the supply of food and water will decrease, so that a negative loop will occur and the problem becomes even harder to solve.\n",

              "With the development of the modern society, people lives longer. Statistics shows that worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 66.57 years for 2009 according to CIA World Factbook 2009. In the developed countries like Japan and Switzerland, the life expectancy can be as high as more than 80. Normally, people will regard the extended life expectation as an achievement, and usually use such data as a measure of the development of the countries. However, as the population is ageing, the challenges such as increased medical cost and shortage of workforce are also realized. In a nut shell, rising life expectancies can be considered both an achievement and a challenge.\n",

              "Indeed, thanks to improved living standard and medical care, countless people's lives are extended. No doubt life is the most precious treasure of human beings. Without life, we have nothing. In the long history of the evolution, we are always struggling for life against staving and illness. In last two centuries, we human have made the greatest achievement in developing our society. We are modernized and we have gained improved living standard and medical care. We are no longer bothered by starving and common illness. In the ancient times, the residents may only live for 30 years; but now, the life expectancy can be 80s in many countries. With a doubled life time, humans can have change to explore the real meaning of life. There is a Chinese saying that there is nothing more valuable than to save a man's life. Hence, the rising life expectancies no doubt can be considered as a great achievement.\n",

              "<p>\n",
              "On the other hand, the aging of Population can also be a challenge to the society. When people grow old, they will be weak and get sick easily. That is the natural law which nobody can violate. Hence, when the ratio of the seniors whose age is above 60 reaches some certain point, the challenge to the society cannot be neglect anymore. First, the medical cost will rise greatly. If the individual or family is to pay the bill, they can be bankrupted because of illness. If the medical cost is covered by the government budget, the deficit will be a heavy burden affecting the normal operation of the government. Second, the shortage of workforce can also endanger the development of the society. Japan society is now facing severe ageing problem, and the path of development is seriously slowed. There has been a report estimated that at the year 2060, only half of the population in Japan are suitable to work. The same situation is happening around the world. Obviously, rising life expectancies should also be considered as a serious challenge.\n",

              "To conclude, the rising life expectancies must be considered both an achievement and a challenge. To extend our life is not only a symbol of our achievement in developing our society, but also a fulfillment of our original dream. At the same time, we also need to consider the negative effects brought by the ageing population, and then find proper measures to counter the challenges.\n",

When mentioning about the population ageing, media always consider it as a social problem. It is deniable that population ageing can cause a lot of problems, but in the same time, it is also a symbol of improvement. Therefore, population ageing should be considered both a challenge and an achievement. Following are the more specific explanations.\n",

              "The rising average life expectancies can surely cause some problems. Firstly, the aging population is generally of low productivity. It is a natural rule that when people grow older, their bodies will be less flexible and brains will operate slower, so they will contribute less to the society. In addition, elderly people are using same or even more amount of social resource, as they need more medical support and human help caused by their weaker physical status. Furthermore, to make livings, many senior citizens go back to work field. It will also induce many problems. For example, these senior citizens may do the work less efficient and which will lead to a low effective output. To make him or her more competitive so that not be beat by the younger, old people usually accept lower compensation or bonus. This may lead to the younger's lower employment rate and opportunities and thus they have to live with huge pressure and lower living standard to reduce the daily cost. Besides, the elderly with less salary also have to lower their living standard; both the consequences can cause a decrease in social happiness level and drive the whole society in to a less stable situation. There are also some older people live a rich life with their deposits and retirement compensation. They can live a happy life, but actually to the society as a whole, it is a waste of social resource. Also, the growing percentage of older people will cause the maintenance of many traditional thoughts and mindsets which may become a resistance of the positive social change. Above all, the population aging will be a great challenge for the world for it drags the development of a society.\n",

There are many factors which will result in the death of people, such as natural disasters, accident, diseases or suicides. Long life span for the individual himself is a great achievement which indicates he or she is brave enough to face the life full of problems. For the whole society, rising life expectancies are a symbol of more advances science and technology especially in the medical field, better social environment and a safer world.

For a few groups of families, there are even up to eight old people since their grandparents are also live with them. Besides financial burdens, they may also need to spend more energy to take care of them. These may be too much for these young parents as they still need to look after their own children.\n",

              "Population ageing seems to be an achievement when it first happened. In the old times, people could easily lose their life due to hunger, disease, government, war or something else. After a country was just founded, some immature policy leaded to a nationwide hunger. Millions of people could not find food to eat and ended up eating all the trees and grass which could be seen. There was everywhere wandering people trying to find food. Some people even eat their own dead children. There was a saying which says that hunger can bring people back to animals. Infectious disease is also a life killer. Not long from now SARS, as blurry as it is, attacked people all around the world. Since no one knew about this disease before, it spread around the whole world before human taking action. The spreading speed was so fast that plenty of people died before knowing about it. An atmosphere of death covered the whole world. The expression of desperation can be seen everywhere. The war kills a lot of people, which is not doubtful. After going through the WW1 and WW2, the population on the earth got much fewer.\n",

              "No matter because the technology was not developed enough or because there were wars and battles one after another, people just didn't live a long life. Hence, as technology especially in the medical field continues to get developed and updated, people don't risk their lives anymore. People are happy to see that they can finally live a long life without sacrificing their blood in battles and with more and more perfect medical insurance. The medical equipment and staff are getting more and more today. Although some countries in Africa and Southeast Asia still face a lack of medical insurance, the world in all is getting better in the field. With modern machine and growing method, human don't need to worry about the amount of food anymore. All the achievements human make influence the lifespan of people. That is why population ageing can be seen as an achievement.\n",

              "Population ageing is not all about the good side of the society though. As the society develops, people gradually find that population ageing brings us many problems. With more and more people not working at all and receiving the allowance from the government, the society's balance is broken. It is difficult to keep economy functioning well. Times change, people change. Many young people don't view things like their parents used to do. Many young people choose not to have kids or have fewer kids than before. This problem is very common in developed countries. With more perfect system with the old and more modern equipment, population ageing always comes first. The governments are seeking solutions to solve this problem. For example, they encourage people to have more children by awarding them. They pull up the age to retire. No matter what measures they take, the population ageing still remains a serious problem and that is where the challenge lies.\n",

Sooner or later, the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed. All passengers and pilots were died. After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incidence, police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence. Surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future, hence to save more lives.

There are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown. In my childhood, I went there to spend my summer every year. However, it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set.\\\\n\\\\nNext to go will be, the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution. There has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral. No one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented.\\\\n\\\\nLast but not the least, the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence, especially, to our offspring. To take my friend, Taylor, as an example, her homeland were over-developed and become an arid place when she was a child. After she grows up, she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown. In addition, she has no blithe memory in her childhood.\\\\n\\\\nOne problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us. Due to the mineral development, many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before. It seems like a sought-after chance.
