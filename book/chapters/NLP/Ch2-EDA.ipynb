How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear. If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease. The opposite is also true. If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it is still possible that you develop heart disease. However for some rare diseases, people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease. When we are diagonosed out with certain genetic disease, are we suppose to disclose this result to our relatives? My answer is no.',\n",

              "\"Keeping the Secret of Genetic Testing What is genetic risk? Genetic risk refers  to your chance of inheriting a disorder or disease. People get certain diseases because of genetic changes. How much a genetic change tells us about your chance of developing a disorder is not always clear. If your genetic results indicate that you have gene changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it does not mean that you definitely will develop heart disease. The opposite is also true. If your genetic results show that you do not have changes associated with an increased risk of heart disease, it is still possible that you will develop heart disease. However, for some rare diseases, people who have certain gene changes are guaranteed to develop the disease. When we are diagnosed with a certain genetic disease, are we supposed to disclose this result to our relatives? My answer is no. On the one hand, we do not want this potential danger to have frightening effects on our families' later lives. When people around us know that we have got a certain disease, their attitudes will easily be changed, whether it becaring about us too much or keeping away from us. And both are not what we want , since most of us just want to live as normal people. Surrounded by such concerns, it is very likely that we will be too distracted to worry about these problems. It is a concern that will be with us during our whole life, because we will never know when the ''potential bomb'' will explode. On the other hand, if there are things that can help us to control or cure the disease, we can go through this process with the whole family. For example, if exercising is helpful for apotential family disease, we can always look for more chances for the family to do exercise. And we can keep track of all family members' health. At the same time, we are prepared to know when there are other members who have got this disease. Here I want to share Forest's view on this issue. Although some people feel that an individual who is found to carry a dominant gene for Huntington's disease has a moral obligation to disclose that fact to his or her siblings, there is currently no legal requirement to do so. In fact, requiring someone to communicate his or her own genetic risk to family members who are therefore also at risk is considered by many to be ethically dubious. Nothing is absolutely right or wrong. If a certain genetic test for a disease is very accurate and it is unavoidable and necessary to get treatment and to make it known to others, it is OK to disclose the result. Above all, life is more important than secrecy.\""

              "\"On Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic. The road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold-ups and traffic jams.. To remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses, with mixed reception. While the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place. The inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic. It might seem an easy soloution to this  mayhem would be to use public transport; i.e. the Railways. People are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas. It has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route! The main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train. If the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times. Then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk, wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride.\\nMy soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services, this would get people of the roads and onto the trains. To improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six. The train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car.\""

              "'Boxing is a common, well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing, dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned, possibly with good reason.\\nBoxing is a dangerous sport, there are relatively common deaths, tragic injuries and even disease. All professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight. If not killed then more likely paralysed. There have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks. This is just from the elite few, and theres more from those below them.\\nMore deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned. The sport would go underground, there would be no safety measures like gloves, a doctor, paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue. With this going on the people taking part will be dangerous, and on the streets. Dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people, the new boxers could be even more at risk.\\nOnce boxing is banned and no-one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in, there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason.\\nchange the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract form the entertainment. There are all sorts of proposals, lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn, ban punches to the head, headguards worn or make fights shorter, as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds, these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch.\\nEven if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing, even Muhamed Ali, who was infamous(?) both for his boxing and his quick-witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts.\\nMany other sports are more dangerous than boxing, motor sports and even mountaineering has risks that are real. Boxers chose to box, just as racing drivers drive.'"

              " \"In many of the minority works of modern literature, there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces. Although such a show of strength by these works' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author, it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based. However, such a rebellion cannot be seen clearly in each minority work, and, therefore, the products of ethnic American literature cannot be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression. Rather, this ever-changing and ever-challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other.\\n\\nIn the minority works, the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole, and although the mothers in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages, Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions, and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government, the characters' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures. Rebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures, but rather as a binding force between all cultures, for Celie, too, resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple, and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate. Rebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature, but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature. Emphasis changes with each work, and although figures of authority aparticularlyary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple, other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show. This again implies that theethnicnic American pieces of literature cannot be categorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression, but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences.\",\n",
              " \"How does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in 'Candide'? Philosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and any occurence isoccurrence good. Voltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy. In Candide the representa,tive of this philosophy is Pangloss, the philosopher employed at Thunder-der-Troncks. The whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme. For example when Candide is f,orced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not, concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he us,es his training to become a soldier. Although this would seem to be good it is not because of his t,raining he ki. Becausemen, a Jew and an A,rchbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother. Voltaire showsweetheart'se of l'optimisme when Pashowsss, Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors, Candide, Pangloss and a sailor. The stor; was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to. On arrival they see starvation and de. Candide is obviously horrified, especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city. Candide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him t,hat some good will come of it. Candide, although remaining true to the ideals of optimism, always appears to be sceptical of it. This is no more true than when he arrives in the new world, South America, and has to leave his darling Cunégonde with the Commissioner of the province. Candide cannot see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he wa,s in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cunégonde's lovers. Throughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradual,ly lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more ledrtafromy how l'optimisme ,is shown to be the philosoph,y of despair. The constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters. Candide's life, in the book, appears to show this. He is thrown out of Thunder-den-Tronck because he embraces Cunégonde, he is duped into the army, he is caught in an earthquake, he is almost killed as part of an auto-da-fé, he kills three churchmen, he is almost eaten, he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues. Candide's life is goleaves -by his belief the good will prevail. Eventually, of course, he dothatmarry Cunégonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he onc,e loved. She has become ugly and grew worse by the day. This illustrates emphatically the growsy of l'optimisme. Candide has travelled the world in search of Cunégonde, with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through, of cohe. Despite end he does get Cunégonde but at the price of her lo,oks and personality. Voltaire, in Candide, shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope.,\",\n",
              " \"It would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity. Howe,ver it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States. When the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America, they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity. They were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly-formed national government to operate as a single international political force. A balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self-government as possible while ensuring that, for example in military matters, the central government spoke for all. It is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states, but no-one would challenge the fact that, on matters external to the United States, the government in Washington represents the sole policy-making body.\\n\\t\\tIn Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries, since this would produce a formidable international military force. However it, is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities (such as was seen over Europe's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute), the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place. Membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty, but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament, something which no state in the United States could lawfully do. We are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and,ven with 1992 approaching and a single market th,e gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide.\\n\\t\\tThe supremacy of Parliament will never be challachallengedability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty. Even if today it made laws to thwould unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever, it could tomorrow repeal all those laws. The fact that Parliament does not bind itself or cannot be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented.\\n\\t\\tBut with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fulintegratedted with Europe. Even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the, world standing alone against a hostile world.\",\n",
              " 'Naturally, the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive.\\n\\t\\tIt seems to me that, for the past few centuries, Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe. Whenever necessary, she has allied herself to European powers, such as in times of war of ortreme distrust.\\n\\t\\tBritain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent, but throughout history, she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else.\\n\\t\\tIn the latlas-lf cent,ury though, her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe.\\n\\t\\tBecause of her history of isolated sovereignty, it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe.\\n\\t\\tFor instance, British law is based largely upon precedent, that is ju,dge judgementlaw. We have established a system of law which dates back many centuries, and which is widely known and respected. There is very little European influence on our law, of course in many respects . Inwill be the same, but the lack of influence will display many differences.\\n\\t\\tWith the creation of a single Europe, new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent, and it will cause both confusion and conflict.\\n\\t\\tThe British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law, and changes may well cause illfeeling and disconill-feelingourse, the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe. Will there just be one system ?\\n\\t\\tThe country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered.\\n\\t\\tOur individual monetary system I suppose, could be see,n as a symbol of sovereignty.\\n\\t\\tIt can be said that if a single Europe was created, problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts. Of course Britain would lose her sovereignty, as would the other nations of the union.\\n\\t\\tIt has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure, whereby local autonomy could be saved, but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner.\\n\\t\\tTo a certain extent, even if sovereignty was lost, some national personality would be preserved. The fact is that, when united, European unity would still in essence be divided. The,re will always, be aspects of one society that the others will never accept.\\n\\t\\tEurope as a whole faces the same problems, and therefore, if a single Europe was created, uniting Britain, the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently.\\n\\t\\tIf the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity, they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally, so that individuality is preserved, and that all of their positive features will be known.\\n\\t\\tThe problem facing the British, really results from their isolated past. The sovereignty of the nation has deep roots, and the fears of losing it are very great.\\n\\t\\tWhether this would reallyen awaits to be seen, and would depend completely on the terms of the union, and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries.',\n",
              " \"With 1992 now only a year away, the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant.\\n\\tI firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain. This loss need not however be negative. In fact, in political, economic and defence terms, I feel this  reareallocation resources can and will be very positive. Whilst to a ,certain extent I may be, guilty of having an island mentality, I wouldn't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats bureaucrats or Strasbourg.\\n\\tThroughout the world a wind of c,hange is apparent, but especially so in Europe. This process will continue and Europe the rest of th ande world will evolue with or without the evolveipation of Britain in this process.\\n\\tIt is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will decision-makingde the new world order. However to be fully involved, sacr,ifices have to be made. Such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty. In relenquishing and thus centralrelinquishing powers, the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage.\\n\\tAs amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf, European cooperation in the field of defence can  be both impressive and effective. Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central bodyofI can see a future for some ,orm of European rapid reaction force. Whilst to an extent crippling defenc,e costs could be, cut this would not necessarily lead to ,a reduction in the size of defence available.\\n\\tIn political terms, regardless of legislation, Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming in,creasingly cosmopolitan in ,terms of the population composition. The North Sea will increasingly's come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries. I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography. Politically we are moving closer together. Possible problems s,hould be studied and solved if possible before they happen.\\n\\tE.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially ,careful. Whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates, and i,nflation while raising growth, with the possible exception of the Magic Circle. In the area of the single currency, again I feel this is inevitable. What is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEC as opposed to an average based system.\\n\\tTo conclude I would say a single Europe is a-ready happening and that i,t will continue to do so is guaranteed. Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent. If we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes.drown\",\n",
              " 'When the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, the foundation was laid for a new \"continent\" - a united Europe. It was said that Europe would not be created quickly, but over several years. When Britain entered the European Community in 1973, after a national referendum, the debate began concerning BriBritain\\'slationship with Europe. When 1992 was set as the date for the singleSingleean Market, the debate flared up again, but over how far Britain should be integrated. The rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but B,ritain seems to be decidedly hesitant. The former Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead  Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty.\\n\\t\\tThere is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved. Businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992, and the single market. Trade will be easier, with no frontier controls allowing fr,ee flowing transportation of merchandise. There will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices, along with greater freedom to travel.\\n\\t\\tMany Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already, with decimalization, the new Euro-passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU. They may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe. Further changes are forecast for Britain, effecting day taffectingters, to create a \"European Standard\". This may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of \"1992 and all that\". A single market requires one central institution to co-ordinate all movements of goods and policies. Will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels?. Many people wuld not. Will the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ? It may well - but will the Britonse a chance to voice their opinions and views ?\\n\\t\\tEurope may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks. As the date draws nearer, the awareness of Britons about Europe must increase. They must look into the future and consider possible effects. Will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ? Pewill?as more of Britain becomes \"Eurofied\", Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away. Britain has never geographically been a part of Europe. We are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade. We have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone. We have a sound democratic process, which many people would not want to give this up . A fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leadinleadloss of sovereignty.',\n",
              " 'There has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon.  Now that it is a reality, and not just a probability, the question in the minds of many Britons is, indindeed:ll this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation? Firstly, a positive approach.  Looking at things from an economic perspective, this is not a problem.  The benefits in terms of cost-cutting owing to doing things once, instead of twelve times, will be enormous.  Firms, because of being able to pool their resources, will be able to devote more time to research and development, and thus products will improve.  Europe will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition. To look at things on a more individual level, every member of the new Single Europe\\'s standard of living should increase.  A greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will, in theory, result in more knowledgeable and better-informed individuals.  Simplicity is one of the Commission\\'s key aims, with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand, people will be happier, get on better.  If this is so, they should also work better.  Ideally then, there should be more equality, less crime, greater productivity and greater economic growth. On the other hand, will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain?  It must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states, but it is an island - which none of the others are.  Why should this matter?  Well, Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions.  It is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity.  Britons (especially those from older generations) may then feel \"lost\" and that they do not really \"belong\" any more.  The new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it.  Then there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work.  Will there be greater prosperity, better-informed, happier citizens, or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies?  Britain, although small, is more often than not in ate fore of international matters, taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right.  Has it then not got quite a lot at stake, its character at least, in integrating itself into this Single Europe? No one would dispute that this is a difficult question.  The fact remains however that next year (in 1992) there is going to be a Single Europe.  This, as everyone is well aware, is not going to be achieved with ease, but the more tolerant every member state is of each other, the more successful the Single Europe will be.  It is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards toltoleranceThen we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way.',\n",
              " 'The European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co-operation. The community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe. In particular, the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers; movement not only of goods but of services, capital and people. However, the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one: to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community, if at all? Let us look at the founding of the European Community, before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail.\\n\\t\\tThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War, but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent. The political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re-ordering of Europe. This fresh start came about because of three main factorFirstly, was Europe\\'s realization of her own weakness, after having lost her age-old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union. These superpowers were ecmilitarily militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual EuSecondtates. Secondly was the conviction that militaonflict should in the future be avoided; after all, the two great wars had bothThirdas European \"civil wars\". Thirdly was the common desire for a better, freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way. One of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community, in 1958. Its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty-three. One of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers, which it can use to adopt acts, having the force of national law. This novel approach to pooling national so1970snty is called \"integration\". The 1970\\'s saw progress in integration, with the introduction of community policy instruments, which enabled greater scope for national policies. \\n\\t\\tAll of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992, however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded. This is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty, many want unanimous voting, not majority voting. Many see this issue as a threat to lead town regulations and laws, and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm.\\n\\t\\tThe situation is see,n as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity. Whether or not the continuation of the progsuccessfulhe field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe. If a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained, the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over.']"

              "'\\nRisks can be analyzed if there is a record of what was happened in the past. In late nineteenth century, there was a severe air crash happening at Miami international airport. The air cargo of the Valujet plane was on fire after the plane had taken off. Sooner or later, the electric systems were short circuited as a result that the airplane was out of control and nose diving to the ground with extremely high speed. All passengers and pilots were died. After finding and analyzing the black box of the Valujet after the incidence, police investigators found out reasons for causing this severe incidence. Surveillance technology can be used to detect very risky events and prevent its happening in the future, hence to save more lives. In addition, if surveillance technology is even better developed, it can be used to detect the problem before the real accidence has happened.\\n'"
